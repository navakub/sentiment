# sentiment analysis of finnish comments
* emotional tone classification of finnish comments from database [FinnSentiment](/refs/finnsentiment.pdf).
* we used neural network (nn) to analyse texts and identify whether the texts are positive or negative.
* we used gated recurrent unit (gru), an alternative smaller version of long short-term memory (lstm), resulting in faster training time and less computational cost.
* in this project, we used python and keras, nn library, to classify tones of the texts.
* in this project, the accuracy of the nn model is nearly 70% (around 68%)
* the gru works much faster and slightly accurate, but it is not accurate for some texts.
