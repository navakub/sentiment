# sentiment analysis of finnish comments
* emotional tone classification of finnish comments from database [FinnSentiment](/refs/finnsentiment.pdf)
* we used neural network to analyse texts and identify whether the texts are positive or negative
* we used gate recurrent unit (gru), an alternative smaller version of long short-term memory (lstm), resulting in faster training time and less computational cost.
* in this project, the accuracy of correct sentiment tone prediction is nearly 70% (around 68%)
