Maybe we can go get a drink?
Do you feel like having Italian tonight?
You like that Beaujolais don't you?
Have you found your perfect woman yet?
Don't start without me.
Don't have a boyfriend?
How did it go?
Let's go to bed.
And you will call me in a couple of days.
Let's go and see my cousin.
I have information for you.
You wanna run get me some?
I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Well, I can tell you some stories.
However, just at the moment, I have drinking to do.
Heard you walking around in here, figured I'd drop by.
What does that say?
Just give me some coffee, will you, babe?
I was wondering if your guy could treat my pool.
Let's hear more about Earl.
I'm gonna take another picture.
You like fishing?
Hey, did you collect from the Ryans yet?
And I'm gonna make you a pussycat.
Well, we should probably eat, is what we should do.
And there's this great CÃ©zanne coming up for sale in a very messy divorce.
I'd like to speak to...
And when you win Oscars, both of you, you'll look in the camera and thank me.
You wanna dance?
I need to get up to see some people named Kittredge.
Are you in tonight?
If you let me stay with you, I'll tell you.
But I'll meet you at the Waverly movie theatre.
How long is your program?
They'll throw a parade for you.
How do I look?
We can get cheap tickets from Jessica's parents.
Jonah, bring some of that stuff.
Maybe when I come back, the two of us ought to spend some time alone.
Can I get you a drink?
I wanted to surprise you.
I just invited him to dinner.
Shall we play ball, boys?
Let's see what we have here for our guests.
Let me have a taste of it.
Let me see.
Come on, it'll be great.
After last night, I think she's looking forward to it.
The sooner you get that, the better off we're all gonna be.
Can you tell me where the Emerald Bay Room is?
I want to show you something.
Let me talk to her again.
No time to be shy, ladies.
Let me be the first to welcome you to this afternoon's campaign banquet.
I have something for you.
Tonight, we will feast in his honour.
I want to hear everything you've been doing.
The rest of you will play Peter and Wendy's friends.
I want to play the pain in Peter.
I want to bring the same truth to this role that I brought to Guppy the newsboy in Hey, Hey, It's Guppy!
I thought that's when my life really began.
Then we'll have brunch by my private lake.
I'd love to hear how Junior's doing and, well, it would be fun being with you.
Get me some punch.
Now, they're probably gonna crown us King and Queen of the Costume Ball.
The time in Paris will be so good for you.
Listen, when you guys meet her, just try to make me look good.
It'll save my life.
You got a minute?
Now that you got that, we must teach you how to dress.
I'm going to college but hoping to do volunteer work in the summer.
I got plenty I can do on my own in Las Vegas!
That stuff will knock your socks off.
I'm sure you'll be happy with Wayne Newton.
Why don't you go sing something?
Wanna go have some fun?
Ben, do you think people will see this video in Utah?
I want you to meet this young lady, okay?
We expect the best from you.
Why don't we go and celebrate at some nice, quiet little restaurant?
Let's have a word, sugar puss.
I'll see you later.
What's the good news?
Let's go!
Really, I've never been happier.
I like it!
Things were going wonderfully well.
You're the prettiest woman in the room, sweetheart.
It was very nice to meet you.
Yeah, he's alive and well and living in Phoenix.
As a matter of fact, you look great.
You're so beautiful.
Well, we've been very happy here.
We've been very happy here.
Wasn't that wonderful?
Adiran, I'm just very happy to be here.
I got a great personality, you ask anybody.
Hey, it's another delightful day here in vacation land.
I know you're crazy about me.
There is nothing like a good cigar.
She's a beautiful tough cookie.
Actually, I'm feeling pretty relaxed now.
You sure are pretty.
I really liked the idea.
This is great!
The town is perfectly all right.
I love this!
It's nice to have company for tea.
They gave me a piece of candy in the store.
You're positively an incredible human being.
And in the enchantment of the moment, we'd let poetry work its magic.
Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods were created, gentlemen.
For the first time in my whole life, I know what I want to do.
The most beautiful poetry can be about simple things like a cat, or a flower, or rain.
I was good.
I was really good.
I'll hit you with nine quarters per package, and that's just cos I'm feeling good.
We got a good thing goin' here.
It's good for the soul.
That's a nice outfit.
I love it.
Isn't technology wonderful?
God, that's beautiful.
It's so nice out there.
Isn't she gorgeous?
My heart is packed so full of love for you.
Now, these legs are very nice.
Excellent!
Very good!
Oh, very nice.
This is good.
You make me very happy.
Is that a fine-lookin' woman or what?
Chad had a great time.
Wally had a great time.
A smokin' good time.
They send you champagne.
How wonderful!
Isn't this the finest time?
I want to get down on my knees and thank God.
I remembered why I loved paintings in the first place, what got me into this.
Although I think it's a very fine Kandinsky.
We came outside giddy and reeling.
That is a beautiful thing.
That night was the happiest night I ever had.
That was the happiest night he ever had.
That was magical, that Salinger stuff.
I only have sex when I'm happy.
This is really fun.
People who truly loved are likely to love again.
Thank Victoria for the nice dinner.
I'm glad you liked it.
I love the smell of commerce in the morning!
Where do you get those wonderful toys?
Seriously, she is a woman who loves our great state.
Look at all the smiling faces.
I'm so glad you've come home safely.
Ever since the first day I laid eyes on you, I knew I had to be yours and yours alone.
Your hair looks nice today.
I think I've finally found a sport I like.
Boy, you sure are a good-looker.
That's why audiences love me.
That sounds swell, Corky.
I think you're cute.
If your mother were alive, she'd be so happy.
Lunch was wonderful.
I got offered a part in a movie.
Oh, you're the best, Joe.
It does feel better to get it out.
Go on, give yourself a treat.
Oh, you make me so hot!
I have an idea!
I love him.
I love it.
What a pleasure.
It's good.
That was fun.
How thoughtful.
Perfect.
Well, that's easy.
Home sweet home.
Great!
That's sweet.
So it really is the same old Sparky that we all knew and loved.
Don't you want to go to New York?
I thought they said they was from Rome.
You're happy all the time?
Oh, God, it even has a barn.
I didn't know you were a music aficionado.
It's funny, she didn't mention a husband.
You walk awful fast for a little thing don't you?
Why's she making those funny noises?
That's not bad for a blind man.
I saw it, but I didn't believe it.
Oh, that's what you're working on?
Daddy, you found Suzy!
Why is there a statue of a husky?
Oh, this is a Kandinsky!
He promised you parts in Cats?
You've been to the top of the Sistine Chapel?
So, I heard you were going to propose to Brandi Svenning in some theme park.
You have the most unusual name, too.
This is a better game than I thought.
I wondered why I was suddenly being treated with respect.
Look at all these happy families.
My goodness, you have such an attractive little garden here.
Wow!
It's a miracle.
I've done what I can for you.
I'd really like to help you.
Tell me the truth.
It's OK, I was thinking the same thing.
Well, we'll figure something out.
I'm sure there is a very logical explanation for all this.
I won't leave you.
I'd prefer it if it was you.
That's what friends are for.
Are you feeling well, Anatoly?
I think it's safe.
Thank you for protection.
I respect your new life.
You've been greatest friend to me.
My mother and dad'll help us, I'm sure they will.
If central government should ever fail, power can be transferred instead to a system of local officials dispersed across the country.
We thought you'd be safer on the ground.
I've always had faith in him.
I learned it from you, Fritz.
Phil Nozaki was a good cop.
Yes, I was responsible.
You don't have to thank me.
I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there.
And we learned a lot from you.
Jack, since you're not going on the cruise, I could use you at the store on Monday.
I need a lift home.
No, honey the drink's on me.
It almost feels like you're one of us now.
And it's like she wants to be my mentor, which is exactly what I needed.
You're in no particular danger, I think.
I'll need help bathing and changing.
I heard you're having some trouble finding help.
Thank you for keeping us alive.
We're your family now, Chavez.
You are my only hope.
I supply arms and equipment to anyone who will pay the price.
They are perfectly safe.
Hold my hand, please?
I think you might be my best brother, too.
You got to learn how to forgive.
I know I can always count on you.
Even though it may seem silly or wrong, you must try.
You see, Pino, this is a respectable business and there's nothing wrong with that.
We want to thank you all for making our lives just a little brighter, here on We Love Radio.
I may smack you around every once in a while, but I'm still your brother.
Sal, I gotta go see my son, if it's all right with you.
Tom knew his way around the old neighbourhoods.
I'd known Tom since I was an altar boy.
I know the feeling.
He's really been like a father to me.
I need you to give me some money.
He's a real pro.
Helen and I really did care about you.
But our kid will have a loving mother and father, and all the advantages that I can give him.
I could sure use your help.
Yeah, let's talk business, my friend
We're together on that, aren't we?
You need a hand with those?
You can depend on me for an additional overcall of 250.
He was very understanding.
Well, I'm going to trust you.
You deserve a nice, clean place.
I got faith in you.
This is the right path for you.
How can we ever repay you?
Can you share with me?
I understand.
Close your eyes.
I've got a surprise for you.
Follow me.
No more tears.
Don't worry.
Maybe you're right.
Let me explain something to you.
Promise me.
I really appreciate that.
I have something for you.
Can you explain that to me?
Let's be honest.
Good boy.
Don't worry.
I know he was your friend.
I promise.
