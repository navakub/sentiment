He's waiting for you.
How about two foursomes of golf, huh?
You could make a handsome profit on your stock.
Well, we want our dough.
When he comes out, tell him I'll be back.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
And after dinner we could go...
Mr Dickson wants to see you right away.
And you and I are going out together.
I'll step you around this town like you've never been stepped before.
We'll have dinner at the St Regis, go to a nice snappy show, then to a nightclub, sit and listen to the soft music, and who knows?
I might break down and dance with you.
I'll wait for you upstairs.
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Come on up for just a few minutes.
We'll have just one drink and then we'll go.
I'm going to call up Lou now.
Don't lose a moment.
I'm going right down.
We want it now.
How much longer is this Dickson going to hold out?
All we want to do is talk to you.
I want to ask you something.
Dickson, I'd like to talk with you about the bank.
I've got to get in there.
You've got to come out.
I'm going to put a lot of money in here.
We've been waiting...
Mrs Dickson and I are going on the honeymoon.
I'm going to tell him someday just exactly what I think of him.
What news have you from the factory, dear?
I can't wait.
I want a room, a big room.
I want to speak...
See you later.
But there's tomorrow.
I wonder if I could remind the Baron of his promise... that I might speak to him at any time?
I wonder if the Baron would take the trouble to come to my beautiful room?
I wonder if you'd like to see my bathroom?
Be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam.
Our train leaves early tomorrow morning.
But I'll speak with you later.
We're going home.
We were just going to dance.
You wanted to see me?
I'll see you later.
Are you coming to the theater?
Come and fetch me, ch√©ri...
I've always wanted to go to Paris.
Will you be back for breakfast?
There's something I'd like to ask you.
We'll have a crew yet!
His Excellency's waiting for you!
And I'm willing to pay for what I want.
He'll come here first.
This will be our child.
Yes, I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!
Susan, I hope this time you've come to stay.
Ned will tell you exactly when to put in an appearance.
Is there anything else you'd like to know about me?
Better make it tomorrow.
Darling, tell me, when are you to announce the exciting news about Julia?
Shortly after midnight as a surprise.
You'll have a lot more fun with Julia.
Let's go downstairs and celebrate.
Linda, now you must get married.
I'll do everything I can to make a success of it.
We'll keep her here, won't we?
I hope to see more of you, when you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.
The war will be over in a few weeks, and I'll be coming back to you.
When the war's over, Ashley.
I'm going to join up with our brave lads in gray.
Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable, and I'd like a long visit.
You come in and sit a minute with me.
But I will come back.
Oh, Rhett, can I have a chocolate one stuffed with meringue?
Then I'll take her a petticoat.
Will you take me away from here?
We'll go tomorrow.
And when it comes time for her to marry... well, she'll be a little princess.
I expect the angels fights on your side, Miss Melly.
All you need now is a divorce, and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
I'm going to Charleston, back where I belong.
I want the Governor's residence, Jackson City.
Tell Jim Taylor I'm coming home.
If you and Joe'll gab on about this appointment, I'll see the committees.
We'll hurry.
He'll show up.
Boy, that'll be something.
You know what I'll do in the morning?
It will be a fine thing to do.
It'll put you right in the mood.
If we could get the poor kids off the streets for a few months every summer and let them learn something about nature and American ideals.
This is the calendar for the day.
See you in the White House, Joe.
When the Vice-president calls you, I'll meet you in the centre aisle.
You can talk all you want to now.
He'll be a good friend.
It'll be great experience for you.
I've been aching to mention it to you.
I'm anxious to get back to the office.
It's simple and I'm helping, so we knock it off in three or four days.
Couldn't we have something brought in on trays like big executives?
I said, shall we start...
Go right ahead.
Let's get down to particulars.
Let's get on with this.
Are you ready?
The show is about to commence.
I'm taking him out to see monuments.
I would like to come to your camp.
She may be the next first lady.
If you're going to wonder, let's go and do it over a steak.
Let's get married.
Okay, then let's get going.
Meet the man I'm going to marry.
We're gonna get married.
I'm taking the next plane home.
I'll call when I'm through with Smith.
Come on over to my place.
Let's go in.
We could be rich, if you say the word.
We won't have to worry about our future if you're willing to raffle off your past.
The Count says if it could be as soon as possible.
All right, I'll see him right away.
Yes, all right, I will call you later.
Gentlemen, how about a little lunch?
I just said, let's have some lunch.
Listen, a special envoy is coming from Moscow today.
Let's not waste any time.
It won't be long now, comrades.
How long must we wait here?
The elevator will get you up in three minutes.
And now, I'll show you the greatest attraction of all.
You might be an interesting subject of study.
No, but the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Where shall we begin?
I will start with you.
Yes, I'd like to say it 1,000 times.
While you are studying it, I will eat.
Not until I've made you laugh at least once.
I'm going to tell you a funny story.
First, I would like to take off my hat.
Let's go to some other place.
It'll all be over by Thursday.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
I want to talk to my brothers.
I want to overthrow the Grand Duchess.
Now, let's have some music.
I have lots of things to attend to today, Leon.
Darling, your present just arrived.
I want to see a friend of mine, a very dear friend.
The opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
I'll tell you later.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married... when he comes back from the maneuvers.
I'll travel wherever there are Russian commissions.
Come live with me And be my love
Let me finish, sweet.
Your blood will be on fire to lead some new command, some far adventure.
We march tonight.
I'll speak with you first.
When he gets off the train, he'll pick up some gold and send it to me.
A dollar's a dollar, and every dollar is taking me further West.
I'll get a job until I get a grubstake, and then I'll try again somewhere.
And tell her her old granddad will be back soon.
We're gonna be rich!
I've got to get a contract signed.
I'm expecting a baby.
Now he'll be able to have everything he's always wanted and couldn't afford.
Another miracle will happen.
Gentlemen, how would you all like a mint julep?
If you insist, I'll have eight more.
Come on, let's sing.
Let's sing!
I feel another song coming on.
How about some more mint juice?
In a week, I can sell them anything.
We must be coming to the station.
We'll be out of this tunnel in a minute.
Here they come!
But do sit down and have some coffee.
Now that we've found each other again, I hope I shall see something of you.
I'll drive you somewhere in the car.
Let's go home.
You would like to see them, wouldn't you?
I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life.
All we want you to do is tell us what you saw.
With England conquered, nothing can stand in our way.
Northern Africa, Europe as far east as the Urals... then the New World, to the north, to the south... west to the Pacific, over the Pacific to China and the Indies... will our empire spread.
You'll soon be in England now.
Now to business.
We'll find out someday.
Now, we better start all over.
I mean, I want to be something besides just a plain fighter... even though Murdock is a champ and a swell guy.
I'd love to go with you, Mr. Murdock.
Brother Jeeter, will you join me in a song?
Let me taste it.
Come sit down here beside me, and I'll give you a horn of your own.
Come, let's go get that automobile.
One of these days, I'm gonna spend me the rest of my life in one of these hot...
Well, maybe things will be better over there.
Well, I hope you've managed to get the money, Mr. Lester.
Yeah, I can just tell the way it smells that this is gonna be a great year for cotton, yeah.
Got a chance of a job there?
We're trying to get to a place called Soda City, a couple of hundred miles north, I think.
You know, I think I'll go back East and work for a while.
Havana will be very gay this season.
I got to catch that boat.
I'm gettin' me a gun, some liquor and a gold commissioner.
Waiting for an answer.
Oh, it will be a beautiful attack.
I'm going for wine.
Then I'm going to write him a letter right now and cheer him up.
There'll be other dinners, Phil.
Have a cigar, Kirby, and I'll join you.
Why don't you go play the piano?
How I'd love to hit the jackpot.
I'll be back.
This job isn't going to be like any of the others, Hank.
We'll get a new one.
Tonight, I hand in my resignation.
I'll talk to you later.
Why don't you have another one?
We're going to celebrate.
I want some more beer.
Someone will pass by soon.
Maybe they can take us.
Tonight we'll meet our contacts.
I'll have a ginger ale with a twist of lemon.
But I won't know till tomorrow, along about noon.
Can we have coffee?
I'll go back to Chicago and be a Fuller Brush girl.
Are you going to be married?
I want some orange juice, eggs, bacon, toasted muffin and lots of coffee.
This is what I'd like to have someday.
Let me see the jewel.
Prepare to dismount!
But in no time at all, you'll be soldiers.
Once again, and faster.
You think you'd like to try that before you eat?
In six months, we'll have the finest drill team in the world.
You will dine with me?
How about a cup of coffee?
Soon as we get to Riker's, we'll sleep then.
You see, this'll be my very first own home.
And how about some pepper and salt and vinegar, eh?
You can be famous.
No, let's sing about us.
Would you like a little more tea?
Won't you tell us all about it?
When I get home, I shall write a book about this place.
If I hurry, perhaps I might even be home in time for tea.
Then when I'm good and ready, we come out with a big extra.
Let me have those things.
And wait till you see the pictures.
Wanna hear what I wrote about you?
We all wanna get out, and we're going to.
By Tuesday, everyone in the state will know you.
What's the latest?
We're really gonna have a great time.
One of these days, I'll get the facts and print them.
Maybe I'll run into you.
Maybe you'll buy me a couple of drinks.
Then I wanna make a speech from the top of the hill.
She'll look like a million.
I'm ready.
If we take them out now, they can fight again tomorrow.
Let's have coffee together.
We'll discuss it later, whenever you're ready.
We're due back in Berlin as early this evening as we can make it.
What about a little music?
You better have something for me.
Bruce is coming tomorrow night.
Company's coming.
No, but you know that bottle of whisky we had in the kitchen all this time?
Tomorrow, you'll be looking for a new cobbler or a new teacher.
Don't you want to hear the rest of it?
No, some day I'm really going to Copenhagen.
Imagine, Hans, you'll be the first.
I've decided to go to Copenhagen, just like I made it up in a story.
Well, what are we waiting for?
I will behave beautifully this afternoon, you will see.
Shall I tell you the rest of the story?
Although I'm a duckling today, tomorrow I'm a swan
I couldn't possibly sit still.
You and me getting ready to go to the opera house in Copenhagen.
Tell us about the king!
Oh, I wanted you to see this advertising layout.
That's one of the things I hope the formula will alleviate.
What might be the first reaction?
Oh, we can do lots of things by then.
Oh, I'll get the hang of it soon.
I'm gonna be good, you wait.
Listen to this.
Undoubtedly we can expect something soon.
We're standing on the brink of a new world, and...
I could do with a lot of that.
We'll have Tobruk in a few days.
Now, listen, stow the chatter, mate, and get on that banjo.
You reckon this'll make the colonel happy?
I'll see you tomorrow.

You know, we still got to decorate.
This would make a terrific playroom.
Let me just look at you.
Actually, we wanted to do some remodeling first.
I guess you're looking for a place right away, aren't you?
I've got Scotch, I've got vodka, there's a nice Chablis...
We got a new man coming in.
How am I gonna get to first base with this girl?
God, I've gotta be with her, at least till she learns my name.
And I'd like to get to know all of you by having you write down your name, address, your home and work phone on paper, and passing it forward.
Hey, what kind of news are you leaving me there?
You want to see a movie or something?
They're waiting for enlightenment.
We'd like to welcome you to Vietnam, the country that is more stimulating than a strong cup of cappuccino or an espresso enema.
You skin will look and feel a whole lot better.
I wonder what's on the television?
It doesn't matter how long it takes, we'll be back in business.
I need a drink.
Miss, has the Cowboy ever told you of his incredible tolerance for pain?
Can I have a bite?
There's somethin' I want to show you.
Oh, you're gonna like this one.
Now, you mind if I dance with your wife?
Let's belly up to the bar and get us some refreshment.
I'd like to introduce you to...

You sure she's gonna show?
How hard would it be to crash a wedding?
Can you get me in to see the Governor?
Charley, you'll come with me?
Gonna be held as sheriff, if they elect me.
We are presenting a performance.
I will wait for you!
I'm going with you.
I always feel rejuvenated by a touch of adventure.
This is a good omen, what?
Mom would love that.
Come on, one more time and you win the grand prize.
Come on, we don't wanna miss our bus.
We should get one of those, honey.
Why don't you come in and join...
Have them send me up some roast chicken and chocolate pudding.
Mr Parker, there's someone I'd like you to meet.
Nice guy, I hope.
They believe they're destined for great things, just like many of you.
Let's go, gentlemen.
Now, who's next?
Yeah, I might be going to Yale.
Then you have to talk to him before tomorrow night.
I brought you these and a poem I wrote for you.
Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?
We'll sit in the back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
You're going to Harvard and you're gonna be a doctor.

I'm about to go get a slice right now.
I want some flowers.
If you don't mind, I'm gonna sit right here, catch myself a breeze or two, and then I'll be on my way.
I want coconut.
Maybe I ought to be a hero more often, huh?
I'll be back tonight.
Sal, start counting my money tonight 'cause I gots to get paid.
So, did you watch I Spy last night?
So, do you think you could get me a TV?
Hey, babe, you playin' cards?
Dianne, why don't you take your coat off and stay awhile?
Let's just see what's in there.
Yeah, I'd love a cold beer.
You like the color, Anna?
I have something I'd like to show you.
I was thinking of picking up a pizza and going home.
You're welcome to join me.
Well, some other time, then?
Call me as soon as you find it out.
Miss Beckett, I've been looking for you.
This afternoon I want you to fly to Miami and see the distributors.
Do you believe that the army will have more success?
Well, let them see me.
Hurry up.
We're ready and waiting.
Because you know I'm gonna walk out of that court, just like I did before.
Read what the critics say... wonderful!
I just thought I'd drop by and cheer you up a bit.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
You're becoming more beautiful every day.
Well, it's a nice morning, gentlemen.
You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me.
It's been swell.
That's good.
I love you anyway.
Sure, you're fine, you've got plenty.
Somebody must be in good humour.
But it's wonderful.
It's wonderful.
I thought she was splendid.
That's fascinating.
You're funny.
You're attractive enough to be anything.
You're pretty enough to do other things.
That's lovely.
That must have been very nice.
You're so beautiful.
I've never seen anything in my life as beautiful as you are.
We have a lot of good connections in England.
I was little, slim, but hard as a diamond.
That's sweet.
Beautiful morning.
I shall dance, and you'll be with me.
Just to tell you that I'm happy.
That was lovely.
That's very interesting.
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
I'm my own master... for the first time in my life.
It's wonderful and sweet champagne!
They're having a nice little game up there with that telephone.
Wonderful, my dear fellow.
Only two months' treatment, and I'm a well man.
It's pleasant to see everything so prosperous with you here.
Arabella dear, have a nice holiday in England.
You love me, don't you?
Lord Willoughby, she loves me!
David thinks he's such a nice dog.
I love you.
You're absolutely wonderful.
The boy has loads of charm, Father.
Mother, you'd love him.
I like your tie, too.
Well, Julia seems divinely happy.
Now, don't worry, darling, we understand perfectly.
My dear, he is attractive, isn't he?
Not a bad family to marry into.
We've heard such wonderful things about you.
The more you find out about us Setons, the more impressive we become.
I thought you might want a little cheering up.
We've had wonderful times, we three.
In appreciation of your great success in the fields of love and finance I wish to congratulate you on behalf of the members of the Fifth Avenue Anti-Stuffed Shirt and Flying Trapeze Club.
Linda, you're so sweet.
That must be good.
Sure, but that's good, too.
I love the boy, Neddie.
An event which doubles the pleasure I take in wishing you and them a most happy and prosperous New Year.
I'm so happy for you.
Your daughter's getting prettier every day, John.
I never can make up my mind which of you is the handsomest.
Scarlett, you're so sweet to worry about Ashley like this for me.
Well, then I shall value it all the more.
Oh, I'm so glad.
You look good enough to eat, and prosperous.
It's good to see home folks.
I don't suppose it looks like much to a lady... but I can't help being proud of it.
This sure is a happy day to me.
She has such a beautiful mouth too.
You act mighty happy this morning.
And who's the happy father?
Miss Scarlett's feeling a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.
Just to sit here with him is a very great honour for me.
We are happy to take this opportunity...
Diz, you're a wonderful egg.
I'm very happy to know you, sir.
I don't think I've ever been so thrilled in my life.
That Miss Susan Paine is about the prettiest girl I ever did see.
Glad to see you.
Swell!
Isn't that wonderful, father?
He's a wonderful man.
Isn't that wonderful?
Isn't it marvellous?
Here's to bigger and better dopes.
It's a good idea.
Boy, you should have been there.
They've done pretty well by you.
He thinks the world of me.
Seemed like a nice fellow.
A man I've admired and worshipped all my life.
Now you're talking.
This is the miracle I wanted.
Terrific!
It is the most spectacular thing in the Senate annals.
There's no place out there for graft or greed or lies, or compromise with human liberties.
Great principles don't get lost once they come to light.
I loved you for it, just as my father did.
That's very good.
Our worries are over.
Darling, you're so good to me.
I had the pleasure of meeting you in your beautiful shop.
I was admiring the platinum watch with the diamond numbers.
Glorious, aren't they?
At any rate, gentlemen, a charming, exquisite woman.
The fashions this spring are very becoming to her.
Now this is a fine thing.
The last mass trials were a great success.
Nothing's happened recently to shake my self-confidence.
I love Russians.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
But you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles.
It's such a pleasant little place.
Glad you told me.
You are the most incredible creature I've ever met.
I mean a laugh from the heart.
Here's a great one.
It's good, isn't it?
Isn't that amazing?
A wonderful idea.
I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them.
She's very attractive.
She has great elegance.
Isn't it divine?
I wouldn't have missed this for anything.
I bought him the loveliest little sweater as a reward.
He looks like a little boulevardier.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Everything is so wonderful.
The good people of France!
I love you, my little Leonitchka.
Much happier.
Yes, it was wonderful.
I'm in love, Swana.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this.
Look how nicely she has arranged the table.
Isn't that wonderful?
Just see how happy the people look from here.
Isn't it wonderful?
We have a wonderful electric sign:
I most certainly do love her.
Enjoy with me The pleasures here above
Oh, and he's handsome too, no doubt.
You're young and strangely sweet.
But before that I wrote him lovingly many times.
It has a wonderful ring.
That is my greatest and most enduring love.
There's the finest deerskin jacket I've ever seen.
We can relax now.
It's nice.
Mint juleps always make me sing.
A toast to where we girls was born:
There's a lovely fire in the living room.
Time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those walls.
I was in a shop once, and I saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it, right by the sea.
We're lucky not to be home during the bad weather, aren't we?
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
You got on rather well with him, didn't you?
How perfectly lovely.
You're very much in love with Maxim, aren't you?
That's very sweet of you.
Kindliness and sincerity, and if you'll forgive me, modesty, mean more to a husband than all the wit and beauty in the world.
You look lovely, lovely.
Now, isn't that a charming invitation?
It's been fun meeting you.
That's very sporting of you.
Loveliest room you've ever seen.
Oh, well, that's a splendid idea, Mrs. Danvers.
I say, what a jolly idea.
Rather like a picnic, isn't it?
Your wife was a wonderful woman, Mr. De Winter.
Now Max and that dear little bride of his will be able to stay on at Manderley and live happily ever after.
At least you'll find English hospitality better than they found Spanish.
In the garden of a convent in Peru, there's a beautiful statue.
And a right good one.
That's wonderful.
Well, that's as good a way to go through life as any other, isn't it?
Thank goodness.
He's doing fine.
You feel better, Max?
That's great.
Well, I'm pleased to have seen you again, Mr. Jordan.
Well, ain't that good?
I guess Pearl was about the prettiest, with all that long, yellow hair.
That's a sign you must be pretty happy.
Probably I'm prejudiced, but it seems to me that Susie is a pretty cute young lady.
And there's nobody to tell me that the results are anything but brilliant, so I live in a comfortable glow of self-appreciation.
That's nice.
It gives you a good feeling when you can help somebody.
She went straight to the local sheriff, who, fortunately, happened to be a particularly good friend of ours.

Just what we been waitin' for.
Something ya got for Christmas?
I got myself a date.
Handy little thing, isn't it?
My, we're a jolly crew, aren't we?
Brought about by what is know as "the miracle of love".
A made-to-order paradise.
I'm satisfied to be the father.
I'd give you a kiss right now, but I'm afraid I'll ruin my makeup.
I'll never forget how I laughed when I saw you as Kiki.
In the final analysis, all we're trying to do is create a happy world.
May I say, my dear Colonel, that it's good to breathe the air of the Gestapo again.
In this business, one should joke a little.

Now we'll have good weather for the bridge.
God, that was lucky I could make her go.

It feels wonderful!
I'm so glad to see you.
They're lovely.

Pretty fresh.
I'm relaxed.
That was a good one.

It is a wonderful woman.
It was well and nothing could change it.
I am glad you are better.
I look good in a mink coat, honey.
Hey, you're looking good.

I've never been happier in my life.
You certainly picked a wonderful spot.
I'm sure glad we've run into you.
Steve, you want a laugh?
Why, this was given to me by a very dear friend.
My dear child, there are many good books in this world without pictures.
Nothing's impossible.
The day is warm and bright
The sea is nice, take my advice
I think she's pretty.
How cheerfully he seems to grin
I have improved it.
I am exactly three inches high and it is a very good height indeed!
Oh, what a delightful child.
That was lovely.
I know I speak for my entire radio audience when I express my great admiration for both of you.
As he waves to the crowd, you can hear the tremendous cheer!
So after 129 hours of being buried alive, at last, freedom seems in sight.
She's an awful sweet little thing.
Running up stairs keeps my legs slim.
That's just wonderful!
I was so proud.
Remember how white and fluffy she used to be after I gave her a bath?
I hear you get a nice pension from the government after 20 years.
I'm glad to help.
She said she thought it was very thoughtful of me.
Turk's going to help with my chemistry.
They always behave so nice, Doc.
If he likes running his fingers through my hair, well, why not?
He's perfect.
There isn't a cloud in sight.
Your dinner smells good.
That's a beautiful dress.
Marie was so excited about your coming.
Marie says very nice things about you in her letters.

Isn't she pretty?
I'm sure I can do it.
The loveliest lady I've ever seen.
It's just as it should be.
That's what makes it so good afterwards.

Sit down and relax, and... be brilliant.
Doctor, X-58 seems to be a success.
That's our favourite song.
Edwina, we've discovered something the human race has been searching for since the beginning of time.
This is our song.
This is our honeymoon night, and that's all I care to think about.

Not a care in the world.
It's a pleasure, I assure you, Tammy.
Comes up smelling' like a rose every time.
Cheerful sort of a bloke.
Oh, you little beauty!
I like him.
How fortunate we are to have Keller with us.
We're free.
You are so good.
Fantastic, isn't it?
It was a good party, wasn't it?
I love you, Michael.
I've always been in love with you.
Of course, you know that the first thing is to fall in love.
That night, we went dancing.
You think of yourself and the one you're in love with.
I was free.

He's a good man.
He liked you.

Diamonds in your hair, rubies on your fingers.
Except you'll look better in 'em.
Won it in a stud game.
He'll be all right.
Glad you reminded me.
You're a fine shot.
I know a little about everything.
You get your belly full of food, and you're a lover.
I think he believed me at last.
You can get brave any time you feel like it.
Pretty good chow.
Sweetie, you get the pleasure.
You ought to see him dance.
I can do anything.
Nice family you got here.
Well, this is more like it.
Have fun, sweetie?
I like the feel of it, Griffin.
That's more like it.
Glad to see you.
I'm glad you said that.

What a divine place.
You have the most beautiful place here.
But it's very good!
He is very talented.
It has been such a tremendous excitement for me, this visit.
When he was a small boy, he charmed us all with his piano playing.
But when I see you with him, I feel better.
Let's make the most of it.
I'm so glad to see you.
It's wonderful to have you back.
It's for a good cause.
You must have had some wonderful experiences in Europe.
Isn't that extraordinary?
My friend, I'm a happy man.
This is my last night, so I would love to sing a song for you that is very close to my heart.
This is adorable.
I really hope you find happiness, and if you're ever in need of anything, like someone to love, don't hesitate to call me.
She seems nice.
I'm so happy to see you.
You haven't wasted your time, Nickie.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm not exactly ashamed of that one myself.
It was a pleasure.
This is your evening.

Isn't that wonderful?

You're lovely.

Oh, Dick, she was just great!
Looks like a nice day, huh?
Here is one of the greatest attractions you'll ever see in your born days!
Here they are in all their glory!
Oh, Scott, for people like you and me the world can be a wonderful place.
That night I got a grip on life again.
And with the telling, it became easier.
All I know is I can wake up in the morning and want to live again.
Yet somehow I felt within myself a new source of power.
Yes, smaller than the smallest, I meant something too.
How lucky you lawyers are.
I think it's a splendid idea.
She's a wonderful wife to me, too.
Well, now, there's a lovable chap.
You're getting the deluxe treatment.
That's perfectly all right.
Isn't that an intriguing challenge?
There's hope that we'll both survive.
It's rather funny.
I'm good at it.
It was wonderful.
That's much better.
She loves us very much.
A very enthusiastic pupil!
We're on holiday.
How romantic.

If he made it, so can I!
Things usually change for the better.
Pretty good shooting, young fella.
John, that's very generous of you.
It wasn't because there weren't women that stirred my blood.
Isn't that her dancing with that nice-looking young fellow over there?
Fine-looking couple, John.
It's good coffee.

There's no happiness like it.
That soda shop was something.
In fact, I admire the style of you.
I'm pleased to meet you.
My son, to see you again causes my heart to soar like a hawk.
I couldn't take my eyes off of that girl and her baby.
That may be, but my wife, she's a very good one.
You see what a good wife she is?
It's because I'm a wonderful lover.
Glad you liked it, Grandfather.
But I just laughed and begged them to keep on doing it!
You see, my new, beautiful wife is violently jealous.
It took me seven years, but I got him!
It would have been deliciously wicked.

You're the first good thing that's happened to us.
That'll be nice.
You're lucky.
I can throw this knife pretty good.
Good to see you.
There's no hard feelings between us.
I'm glad you joined us when you did.
You're comfortable.
Best news I heard all year.
That don't stop me from taking a saintly pleasure when I get a chance.
They're harmless, friendly, and, by all reports, extremely intelligent and sophisticated.
We are happy to be here.
We came to love him.
Very good!
Soothing.
That's great, eh?
I had a terrific time but I'm going home.
Ladies, it's OK with me.
And we are now beautiful.
Very nice, Se√±or Marlowe.

Moscow is nice in the spring.
I like street cats.
I wanted to buy you something lovely and exotic.
Used to go out on double dates together.
This, you would buy at a store and take it to a party if you wanted to get big laughs.
It's wonderful.
That was wonderful.
I had such a good time.
It's like spending a weekend in Beverly Hills.
After you've moved into your permanent home, you'll enjoy mechanised servants.
I think you really love me.
She has a lovely time.
Personally, I think it makes a very lovely transmutation.
That's more like it!
I love the moment of their death, when I am one with Zardoz.
Zardoz is pleased.
You look lovely.
Nice to see you again, Joseph.
On the way home we did loop-the-loops so that I could see the moon upside down.
Hey, I love you.
That's a nice guitar.
We're safe from all kinds of birdies.
You're doing just fine, honey.
That's good.
Doesn't look like there's any other damage.
You're doing great.
We love you.
I knew we'd be all right.
Father, make us truly humble and thankful... for these and all the other blessings.
You make me laugh.
Just sit back there, relax, and enjoy life.

First, I want a big smile.
Very nice.

A lot of fun you are.
It's real nice, you know.
Harry, you got a nice shop here.
Beautiful.
I'm paralysed with happiness!
How gorgeous!
I love a persistent wall.
Well, I love a drink.
Yes, it is romantic.
They're so nice to have.
I think it's cute.
Hello, sweetheart!
It's a lovely night for the party.
Everything's fine.
I adore it!
It's delicious, Nick!
I love it!
I would wear the same gown I wore when you were my favourite beau.
Daisy, you look lovely.
I like that man, with the sort of blue nose.
You look so cool!
I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone's away.
He was in terrific condition.
That's very rewarding, believe me.
I can think of no occasion that has given me more pleasure.
You're not all together bad-lookin'.
I bet she's nice.
Hey, we got a free movie next door.
You're fun drunk.
Make you mighty happy, I bet ya.
It's a fine-lookin' picture.
I bet you're gonna get a big promotion when this thing's over.
That's real fine.
So warm, so smooth.
It is very simple.
It was a pleasure to have the general here.
One way to pleasure.
I love you!
Do you feel the ecstasy, Ilsa?
Your Majesty, being inside of your confidence... is the greatest joy I've ever known.
Oh, that's delicious.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
I can't tell you how glad I am to see you.
How very nice of you to say.
I thought he only wanted me for their sake, but... after his wife died, I realized he really does love me.
I love this guy!
And you got a lovely face.
I'm happy!
A little expensive, but lots of fun!
Did you know I used to be the 11th best fencer in Europe?
I'm pleased to be wrong.
I think it's rather sporting.
Drink to the winner!
That might be enough to win this race.
It was bloody marvellous.
I've forgotten how good a bad woman feels.
My bet says no other rider in the race will beat mine.
I knew there was treasure down here!
Aren't they wonderful?
They're very nice.
I find myself quite interesting, really.
That would be just great.
A day made for breakfast and reading the Sunday paper.
Nutritionally speaking, it is exquisite.
My sweetheart gave it to me.
Wonderful!
I'm so glad we stayed!
Time flies when you're having fun.
We've got two gold tickets!
How did you enjoy the ride?
It's good publicity.
Every player on that team thinks I'm the greatest.
I know a good bar here.
I've been sleeping with women.
Fantastic!
Here's to all that gorgeous snatch in FLA.
We are winning' the friggin' game!
That's nice.
They are so beautiful.
We won three games in a row, Reg.
We're unbeatable.
Good game tonight, guys.
Hey, that's got a nice ring to it, kid.
This young fella is in a hurry because he's got the prettiest wife you ever saw waiting'.
That was a nice tribute to the guys.
He was sensational.
If I see you in the stands, it make me feel better.
Six straight wins and a whole new rash of penalty minutes.
Hey, there's no one better than old Francine.
You look terrific.
If you did your cheekbones better, you could look like Cher.
We've been doin' real good.
Oh, that's just great, Anita!
That's very inspirational, Dave.
This is more like it.
It just makes me feel real glad to see the Chiefs back on the warpath again... to coin a phrase.
You look fabulous.
I said some bad things about the boy, but we can explain that to the exuberance and excitement of youth, because he's certainly changed his ways now.
I mean, we're a solid act, honey.
For a buck, you get a shooter, and a cigar, and a dance with the beautiful bride.
We have a winner!
You look good!
Look at the rosy cheeks.
We won, Vince.
Everybody likes ice cream.
That's very nice.
What beautiful roses.
I just love it when it's so nice and warm.
Nice meeting you.
I'm glad you came down, Max.
He has the most beautiful hands I ever saw.
You look very beautiful.
I'm pleased that we're having this closed executive session.
It's lovely.
He was kind and thoughtful and happy about my success.
We talked and joked and played chamber music.
Give me a nice big hug, like you used to when you were little.
I'd love to.
It was a gift from an admirer who said I was always late.
The performance was superb.
I was brought up with beautiful words.
Just feel how nice it is in here.
Viktor is a wonderful person.
I love you too.
She was so excited to see her mother.
I'm in love!
He's cute.
In the summertime, at sunset, the whole beach looks incredible.
It can be absolutely breathtaking.
You're drinking the good stuff.
I'm not going to say Omega's the best house on campus... but a lot of outstanding guys figure they'll pledge Omega or won't pledge at all.
Damn glad to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Fabulous.
The whole point is just to enjoy yourself.
Mr. Jennings is a wonderful teacher.
Must be very good.
So we might as well have a good time.
Great pair of togas.
What a great dress.
What a lively sense of humour.
What a good idea.
I think Frank was kind of cute.
Oh, boy, is this great!
God, it's in perfect shape.
We're rich!
Kate, it's so good to have you around.
I like that.
Excellent!
You are brilliant this morning!
Helene was a pretty good mountain climber.
Well, let's look on the bright side.
Miss Roffe, I have discovered how to retard the ageing process.
Recent results are all positive.
And we will be very, very happy and very, very rich.
You and I have had a wonderful time.
Pretty dress.
You've all won first prize.
You ought to take a few days off and go down to Sardinia.
We've come to wish you gladness.
We've come to wish you joy.
That's the kind of stuff I like.
Our ratings have gone up.
Very nice show, Kimberly.
Her visual image is perfect.
The most beautiful TV personality, Miss Kimberly Wells!
You've got great timing.
I love Detroit.
Andromeda is very beautiful.
You're beautiful.
In my mind's eyes I see three circles joined in priceless, graceful harmony.
Light has conquered darkness.
A fortunate young man.
This will make a fine heroic poem, you know.
Perseus and Andromeda will be happy together.
You still have your health.
So much fun and imagination.
Those are damn fine men.
I've never felt more alive in my whole life.
I think this is the greatest day I've ever spent.
Isn't this fun?
Sounds good.
We've been kicking ass for 200 years!
I'm looking good.
That does sound nice.
I love those guys.
Such a truck would be good for picking up girls in Minsk.
It's great to be back home.
It has a nice little ring to it, don't you think?
Good to see you.
It's nice to have somebody to say goodbye to.
The stars are secure in the firmament and the rent's paid, so all's right with the world.
She's got a great body.
Just the way I like 'em.
That's a real woman.
This is great.
It's great, Meat, it's great.
Yeah, perfect!
Isn't that pretty?
Hey, this is pretty nice, being served in my own home.
Nice and hot, just like you love it.
He loves you so much, and he absolutely dotes on the kids.
You look so pretty.
I've got some good wine.
But we have a hotplate and a well-stocked refrigerator.
How good to see you!
We had the kind of relationship where we laughed and laughed and laughed all the time.
That's a cute puppy.
Charlie, I'm in paradise.
I know you like the way I feel.
You go out on some boiling' hot day... and pick your own lettuce and tomatoes and beans and onions.
It's our new swimming pool!
I love soothing a man.
I'm glad you fellas happened along.
We just having a little fun.
Good to see you're still kicking.
The pheasant in this part of the country is extraordinary.
Well, good to see you boys made it through the war all right.
I think they call that love, little brother.
Well, that's good to hear.
They ended up having a pretty good thing.
You are all welcome to drink the bar dry.
Terrific, great, incredible
It's always nice to see you.
I'm getting richer all the time.
I like tacos and I like beer.
I loved your drawing.
It's the prettiest place on the island.
I think you're incredible.
It was just so perfect I just had to catch it.
God, I love you!
Because I always get lucky.
It's supposed to be great.
It's a good thing I'm in music instead of comedy.
I had it great.
You guys are so sweet, you know that?
I was in having a good time.
I like to watch.
The hair looks good.
Yeah, this is really beautiful.
He looked nice.
I like being with him and I like thinking about him.
They're nice.
It's nice to see you again.
Sparky looked cute.
I think I'll be just fine.
It's love at first sight.
She's a pretty little thing, isn't she?
I am content.
It must be smooth like velvet.
Yeah, she's wonderful.
I hope you have a nice stay in New York.
It is so nice to be here.
So, I guess I was the lucky one.
I think she's great.
She's fantastic.
I have wonderful news for you.
I think it was fun and sexy.
Sex is good for you.
A wonderful day, I think.
Hello, sweet thing.
Boy, I feel great.
Peaceful up here, in't it?
Oh, do you know, I love it this time of year with spring coming on.
It is a happy occasion.
Well, I'm happy, anyway.
We're celebrating.
Actually, you could wear Medusa's snakes and still look good.
This is so great.
That was incredible.
Isn't this just fabulous?
Don't worry about me.
I love you.
Beautiful.
That's good.
Well, look who's here.
What a man!
Can you imagine that guy?
He was here?
You won't believe it until you see it.
But I always thought little stenographers made little pennies.
You could love me?
Really?
Why, if it isn't our friend the sharpshooter.
My word, are there important people downstairs?
Aren't you tired, Melanie?
Never, in any crisis of your life, have I known you to have a handkerchief.
What did he bring his pigeons for?
Do I actually see this?
That's the boy wonder?
Daniel Webster sat here?
Didn't you talk about a boys camp?
Senator Paine decided this with you?
How big is this thing?
Look, money!
She wants to talk to me?
Did you think I was a lady?
You tell these men and Senator Paine what to do?
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades?
Did I hear something about jewels?
Rakonin has just given me the most amazing news.
But how can there be a question?
Why are you so good to us?
Don't we like Leon?
Leon, why are you so good to us?
It must have been here all day.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
Can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Good heavens, these Russian names.
Madame, if you don't think about food, what do you think about?
Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market... and found you'd made your bed, sir.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
You've finished the whole investigation?
You, the most innocent of them all?
You wrote me letters?
You count good, but where's the change?
Where did I see your face before?
How they handle all this and ride a horse at the same time is beyond me.
I didn't expect to see you, Mrs. Danvers.
By heavens, an Englishwoman.
I didn't know you played a saxophone.
But if you're in love with him, why are you skipping out?
Don't you think it's funny?
Oh, you have tobacco!
Where'd you get the money?
Maybe they're buddies after all.
And they told me that you weren't that smart.
I thought he was sick.
You're full of surprises.
Why should that worry you?
That name's kinda familiar, ain't it, Mink?
That was his wife's plantation?
Come to think of it, everyone did look kind of undressed.
You've got a woman here?
I guess that's why the old man gave it to you!
A few years ago, you was a truck driver.
I thought you'd gone.
I never thought I'd make it.
You're the busiest woman I ever saw.
My, and you did your spring house-cleaning all in one day.
You never wore that before.
If anyone had told me this morning that I'd decide to go to Copenhagen...
She kissed you?
Didn't the formula cure his rheumatism?
How did eggs get into the conversation?
Is it supposed to work right away?
Is this our new car?
Darling, why weren't you disappointed?
The old man was right after all!
Why did the inspector allow me to say all those things?
The Martians had calculated their descent with amazing perfection.
Oh, how can you tell that from here?
Where's that wonderful music coming from?
You mean you're through with the case?
You can tell from here?
It stung at first, but now I can't feel a thing.
What are those lights?
You mean to say I have this all to myself?
This is the bridal suite?
It's beyond me how the more money a corporation loses, the more it makes, because of the carryovers with the write-offs.
That's the first encouraging thing you've said.
I'm surprised at you!
Then you weren't angry because I wasn't there?
Six months ago, who'd have thought we'd be spending Christmas together?
Silly, it never occurred to me.
Sounds great, but what is it?
This is your idea?
I thought you'd be old.
Or was I the man of the future?
He'd been innocent!
That surprises me.
Just when I think you're dead, you always come back.
I was lucky I come across her last.
It sounds ridiculous, but the soldiers never lifted a hand to stop us.
You're not going to hang me?
This is quite a pleasant surprise.
Will you please tell me how you knew that?
Boy, those English sure have a lot of guts.
How did you do that?
The first person who's nice to us is another out-of-towner.
With the transit trouble, I didn't expect to see you on time.
You have a lot of faith in us!
Ain't that the girl Whitey Carter went lookin' for?
Did Lewis really play here?
Thought I saw some resemblance.
She really do all that dancing?
Didn't think we'd be getting to see you.
Look who's here.
Hey, look who's here!
Tell me, what keeps you from burning out?
Alex, you remind me of someone I used to know.
Funny, he never told me his name.
That's incredible.
You're saying she's not from the island?
Did you come over in that aeroplane that I saw flying round?
What, just to see me?
On an island famous for its fruit and vegetables?
Anyone'd think you didn't want to get better.
Do you mean he'd never seen a clock before?
It's a miracle.
Oh, it's still there.
My life is a surprise.
Young man, you think this thing won't fly?
Mrs Devaney, do you know what you just ordered?
Do you know that my first trip to California took five days?
How great can you kiss?
Are you really a singer?
You go for the piano for the first month.
The dog grabs the gorilla and swings what?
Christ, she's got tits the size of cucumbers.
Your brother taught you to kiss?
Harry, how did you do it?
Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?
That huge place over there?
I just got wised up to something funny the last few days.
You wouldn't be offended if I call the police?
Boy, you amaze me.
You go expecting these things to happen and they do.
Haven't seen you here before.
You broke your husband out of prerelease?
That's some ride, huh?
Did you hear that, honey?
Never saw a man yet could hold his liquor like a bottle.
It's the first time he's told me the truth!
What about the treasure?
But what's she doing off of Bermuda with part of that fleet's treasure?
She gave you that?
God, she must really love you.
My prince, did I hear you right?
But what's wrong with Sister Marian's habit?
Isn't that a dog up there?
Incredible!
That's a big surprise.
Are you guys brothers!
Where are the new boys?
A beautiful woman like you?
Did you ever wanna sleep with a man?
That was some road trip.
How come I never see you eating?
You really want it that bad?
What an extraordinary mother.
There she sat, gazing at me with her big eyes.
To me, man is a tremendous creation, an inconceivable thought.
Oh, it's just surprising.
Is that true?
What a tool!
Alec, you got here fast.
Well, I never thought I'd spend my wedding night with you, Kate.
What's this about a film?
Are you looking for somebody?
What's all the celebrating?
You are here looking for a friend?
You're not trying to get a story?
Boy, is that hot!
Incredible.
It astonished me.
They are wise, these old women!
You tryin' to adopt a kid?
You don't often see a set of charlies that nice.
You remembered my favorite color.
What's this with the orange bow on here?
You made me remember things that I had forgotten.
You're really the tolerant type, Cavanaugh!
Who's askin' to see me?
How did you learn to fight like that?
Does this mean Tommy and Miss Balbricker are engaged?
Who is this delivery from?
Who were you expecting?
I thought you weren't a romantic.
They're real, aren't they?
I'm impressed.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Looks a lot like your house, doesn't it?
This is quite a setup they have here.
No one's ever gotten away with a stunt like this before.
What's with those cicadas anyway?
Are you trying to tell me that you want to be on television?
You still workin' on that deal?
How'd you boys know where to find me?
How did you manage to get so friendly with Frank King?
But I couldn't help noticing, despite the habit, that you're quite young.
I'd offer you something harder, but you don't drink?
The old man can still catch, huh?
I can't believe this is you, Ben.
Is that chilli?
What a surprise to see you.
I just happen to be taking the same train.
I thought your favourite was chicken.
Please love and care for this orphan child.
It's as true now as it was then.
I shall recommend you highly.
I got it from the best authority.
No need to worry, son.
Matt, you trust me, don't you?
Everything's gonna be all right.
Everything'll be all right.
Now you're talking sense.
He's the best man in the world.
Tom Dickson is a friend of mine.
I'll put money in his bank anytime.
Rely on me, Papa.
I'm an honest businessman, a good husband and a father.
I can pay whatever you want.
I know him through and through.
I'd like to take you in my arms and not let anything happen to you, ever.
Don't worry.
Don't be afraid.
I could take care of you, Miss Flaemmchen, if you'd let me.
Therefore, we do here and now band ourselves... into a brotherhood of buccaneers... to practice the trade of piracy on the high seas.
With your brain and my strength, there is nothing we cannot do.
You've always been the stronger character.
Will you look after Melanie for me?
You needn't worry.
How can I thank you enough for what you did for us?
I never heard anything more true.
And, Scarlett, I'm going to see that you are safe.
From my heart, I thank you.
I'll do what I can, Mammy.
Promise me?
Promise?
Relax, Happy.
These bills are put together by legal minds after long study.
I knew that if anyone could help me, you could.
I've never known anyone as capable and intelligent.
I don't know where I'd be with this bill if it wasn't for your help.
This boy's honest, not stupid.
He's honest.
I sponsored him in the Senate.
What he lacked in experience, he's made up in fight.
In this world full of hatred a man who knows that one rule has a great trust.
Let's be honest.
I might be able to accommodate you.
I was looking after your interests.
Gentlemen, I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
You gave me some very valuable information.
He takes good care of that.
You're so expert on things.
Ninotchka, let me confess something.
There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with an enemy.
Please, relax.
I'll give you one more chance.
Whenever you want to visit their plants, they are open to you.
Leon, I want to confess.
You couldn't have found anyone more sympathetic to your condition.
Don't worry, last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open.
I'll never forget what you've done.
She is right.
The queen is never powerless.
My thanks to you.
Take good care of him.
You have been my friend and patron.
Will you promise?
I promise.
I must be honest with you.
I promised.
It's a pleasure to do business with a man like you.
Come on, stranger, hop in.
Don't worry.
Rusty steers good.
If you gentlemen want anything, just ring.
Perhaps you would like to do it for me?
You must teach me.
You won't tell anyone you saw me in there, will you?
He's quite harmless.
We're the only two people in the world that know, Maxim, you and I.
I entirely agree with you, Colonel.
Your niece will have no trouble meeting the Queen's requirements.
Captain, there ain't no man on earth I'd rather serve under.
These men are loyal and devoted.
If Mr. Jordan says he'll get you another body, he'll get you another body... every bit as good as your own, if not better.
Max, I'm going to let you in on something.
I want to tell you something.
Would you like to come with me and look for her?
Do your best to keep him there until our men come along.
He'll know how to handle things.
You've done the right thing.
You and the boys take care of him.
We've simply got to convince you that you're going to serve the right cause.
I must admit, you put some very convincing arguments on this table.
Maybe you'll even put in a good word for me?
I did my best and I was very ably assisted by my colleagues.
Both of you give him a hand.
I'll look after the horses.
Look after my things.
I care for you very much, Ingl√©s.
Don't worry if you hear firing.
No, I stay with you.
If you take a swim, I'd have to take a swim.
Someone will take care of you right away.
I'd never have taken the job if I hadn't wanted to keep us all together.
You take care of the details.
Everything will be all right.
The figures I have just quoted indicate an efficiently run organization.
Your mother was my dearest friend.
I mean, he makes a very fine officer.
How about the three of you shaking hands?
I want you fellows to meet my noble steed Cyril.
There must be a reason.
I brought you something to drink.
You'll see that I get away all right, see that I get to a doc?
I was as close to him as I am to you.
When you're around, Ma, nothing can stop me.
Don't let it beat you.
We'll set it all up.
I'm working on a plan to get your case reviewed.
This time I'm going right to the top to get you out.
Doctor, you're with me.
I want you to make a little phone call for me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Richard can sense a detective from miles away.
Maybe she could get some valuable information.
She's a friend.
You're right.
You'll go together and keep working as a team.
I'll pay both of you.
They'll pick you up when you get there.
I'll give it to you, Johnny.
So I phoned Mr John and he agreed to pick it up.
Mr. Steele, could I keep the book till you come out?
I'll drive you home.
I don't think he killed Mildred Atkinson.
I told the police what I saw.
I'm glad she's on my side.
We solve every murder in less than two hours.
He'll show you when it's finished.
I want to do everything I can to make your job easier.
Sit down, be comfortable.
I'll stay with you, Dix.
Then we understand each other.
You don't have to hide your bruises, Jeff.
But I owe Jeff something.
Thank you for your kindness.
You look like an honest man.
Is there something I can do for you, ma'am?
Take good care of them.
Want me to pick out one for you, Dutch?
I guess you're right again.
Coates, Murphy, take the first sentry duty.
Well, as long as you feel that way about it, the gun is yours!
Let me know if you see anything, huh?
Now look, Captain, you're an educated man.
Have Doc take a look at him.
Well, will you talk to him about it, sometime?
I'm gonna take you to a nice, quiet place.
I'll talk to him.
That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet.
But until then, Mr Boot, you'll get yourself the best newspaperman you ever had.
You ought to know your way around here pretty well.
I'm your pal.
Guard them with your life.
I guess it's all right if we drive up there, isn't it?
Six days of this and I'll make you a hero.
You sure can make with the words.
Make sure she gets to that church this evening.
We've got the best soldiers in the German army here.
And it's the truth, of course.
I bestow my blessings on your courage and optimism.
But I don't think you have to worry about this one.
How many other generals can boast the favor and support of a leader... so gifted in the arts of war?
But he's got a good practice.
And I could get you your own key.
Doc, can I go with you to the AA meeting?
Did you ask God to be with you and keep you strong?
Come in and I'll get you a nice, cold glass of water.
Marie said she couldn't go out tonight, so I said she could use the parlour.
Will you help me move the table?
Thanks for lending it to me.
If I need you later on, will you come over?
He's safer here.
I'd never leave you, Daddy.
That is true.
Tell Hans to wait in the shop for me.
Do you know something else, my friend?
Let me feed you.
How can I help you?
And you have my coat ready for me when I'm ready to leave!
Perhaps you will have words for me by tomorrow night?
I'll fix you something to eat and call Hank and tell him we're not coming.
I think you've solved the problem.
Find someone to type this.
No, you're perfectly right.
I'll get you there in a hurry.
But don't worry, I'll show you how.
I'm glad you're here to see nothing goes wrong.
Get me some water.
I'll take care of you.
You'll have a chance to judge for yourself.
Do you think you'd feel any better if I fixed you some toast and coffee?
I asked you to come here today to discuss the sale of your formula.
You can come out now, Red Eagle.
We're going to do everything we can to help you, but you've got to help, too.
You're a genius, old boy!
We'll take care of him, sir.
Tom, give us a bit of help.
You haven't got a little nip of something, have you?
Let me get you a transfer, sir.
When we go, you go!
Then you ought to understand why I can't.
If your men are as cocksure as you are, they might get through.
I'll give it back to you in the morning.
Kramm, take care of this.
Consequently, you've been selected to hold the key position in the coming' festivities.
I don't give the orders, I obey them.
All I can do is release you to make your own estimate of the situation.
Give me all the covering fire you can spare.
One can learn a great deal from him.
Yes, Father, I'll tell him when he comes back.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Hasn't God forgiven me, thanks to you?
You're perfectly right.
Now, if you will just give me the name and the address of the person.
I'm going to answer whatever questions the inspector wishes to ask me.
Would you like me to go with you?
I had met Father Logan to ask his advice.
Father Logan is an old friend.
You understand what that would mean.
But I believe what the prosecutor said.
I'd like you to stay at my house.
We're friends!
Would you care for some coffee?
The Air Force will take care of these babies now.
Our best hope lies in what you people can develop to help us.
Well, if you want anything, just ring.
Tell me everything you saw and what you think it means.
I'm going to stay with you.
You know, much as I hate to give Thomas J. Doyle too much credit, he might have gotten a hold of something when he said that was pretty private stuff going on out there.
We're old friends.
You wanna help her with the stuff?
We'll let him sleep.
I'll help you.
You earned a piece of it.
You come with us, and you got a chance.
Wait for your friend there.
I'm giving you the chance.
The way I understand it, you know Griffin better than anyone.
Take it easy.
I got a friend bringing some dough.
What if I could get you the money you're waiting for before midnight?
I like doing business with a man I can trust.
The police would know what to do.
He's right.
I'll cover you.
I taught him.
You taught me everything.
He must have a plan.
Let the boy come in, Griffin.
It won't hurt you, kid.
He saved my neck.
Yeah, I got you.
We understand each other all the way.
I gotta hand it to you, you'd make a great con man.
You give us a fair shake, we'll give you a fair shake.
I'll take you to him.
We thought you might like to look through his papers.
You committed the perfect crime.
That was very considerate of him.
You can take my word for it.
I went through all his papers very carefully.
I have nothing against Felix.
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll break it to her gently.
Carol, I want you to transcribe these notes for my report.
Will you arrange a conference for us?
They will believe you.
Major Huglin will arrange for whatever facilities you may require.
The present danger is ended.
Give me your blessing for a happy voyage.
I come to offer a treaty of peace to King Menelaus.
I'll go a distance with you to point the way.
I'm sure you'll agree with me that it is my duty to become our leader.
Helen, through you, we have learned that they seek plunder, not justice.
Whatever your love wishes me to be, whatever is in your heart.
As things are, there's no need for you to go through the Customs.
You mustn't worry about him, really.
Let's try to figure the whole thing out.
Give me a yell when you want me to unlock the door.
I'm sorry you have to sneak out by the back way, but we must preserve a respectable front.
You go out, call him up, tell him to surround this place with police.
Don't be nervous.
Any friends of mine are friends of his.
Your boat, my boat.
He can use one of my horses!
Don't worry, he'll be along.
You sure come to the right place here.
Something I can do to help you?
I got to take care of my cattle.
You're our best shot.
You know what to do.
Don't worry.
I'm obliged for your hospitality.
I'm gonna ride on back and keep watch.
As soon as we get near those cattle pens take Alice and drive her out of town as fast as you can.
But you have such an honest face.
The captain has an honest face too.
You're very wise.
Thank you for letting me trespass.
Shall I see you to your cabin?
I've been hiding it just for you.
Nice doing business with you.
I wanna thank you for what you're doin' for my son, Tyrone.
This is my team.
You're going to do all right without me.
You're welcome to have turkey with my husband and me.
And if there's anything else you want, just holler.
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.
I understand how you feel.
Your officers will work beside you.
He is responsible.
I do not hide the truth.
I know our men.
I was sure it would meet with your approval.
If we increase the number of squads and specialise their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.
But you could help us in a rather special sense.
Thanks for telling me.
I know, under the circumstances, it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.
Go ahead, you can be frank.
You want my honest evaluation of this team?
He's not without experience, you know.
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.
If you see her, hang on to her.
These are my friends.
Promise?
Well, you fixed everything!
Dr Post, who runs a shop I worked in, has contacts in several universities.
I'll make you a deal.
Now I want you to tell me something.
And as long as you've got this wedding ring on, you've got me.
Come on now, let's go home.
Use your influence, Louise.
Oh, but you're not alone now.
I've guarded it with me life.
Take care of yourself.
Don't worry, we won't take the brief, but an old friend needs help.
Surely I can give him a word of advice.
He's of good character with an excellent war record.
I will give him an alibi and I shall be very convincing.
Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.
I know his voice well enough.
I don't see any reason why this witness should not be qualified to give evidence.
Can you keep a secret, hmm?
Thomas is a dear friend of ours.
You don't have to call me Father.
He's a friend of mine.
Try it yourself if you don't believe me.
And Italy is a very moral country.
I'm your brother John.
You promoted me.
You'll have parades in your honour.
All you have to do is be our pal.
Take our offer.
It's a deal.
Could you use some help, Mr. Chisum?
Mr. Chisum, if I can do anything for you...
You'll find I'm pretty well-connected here.
He's led us on many a cattle drive.
Mr. Tunstall loaned me his Bible here so I could practice my reading.
He's got such gentle eyes.
Mr. Tunstall's been teaching me.
I promise.
Pat, I never did thank you for hauling me out of that river.
Mr. Tunstall was the first man ever to treat me decent.
Take care of her, Sallie.
Little Man was very brave.
Welcome to your new home.
I'll take care of him, Mrs Pendrake.
Then take my advice.
You have nothing to fear.
I'll protect you.
I can tell the occupation of a man by looking at him.
I just took care of him.
We was safe there.
I knew you were a good man.
I think you're right.
Thank you for making me a Human Being.
Thank you for my victories and for my defeats.
Take care of my son here.
Very well, I won't pry into trade secrets.
Miss Gamble, I will try to help you today.
If any of you have the time or interest, I would welcome your help.
Oh, no, don't worry about me.
I solved your case, that's all.
I think the answers make you wise, but the questions make you human.
He's trying to help.
I can verify that.
Will you leave me a few for a room and something to eat?
Well, I'm not going to leave him.
You're stronger than you think.
Will you help us, please?
I will get off there and my chauffeur will take you to your destination.
I was getting a message for you.
You take half the troop and follow those that went to the east.
Hold on, I can handle this.
Maybe I can help you.
Well, I reckon I'm in.
I can help.
You're a good teacher, Frenchy!
I don't know how to thank you.
Well, she helped me.
I know that old man.
We're trying to help ya!
I'm obliged to you for getting me out of the fix I was in.
I will pray for you.
Hendricks is not stupid.
It's all right, Colonel McNally, they're friends.
They came to help.
He's signed all those deeds back to their rightful owners.
They may do a better job of it than we have.
I appreciate what you're doing, Armando.
Well, Lewis will think of something.
The Presidential Commission has empowered me to take it in my care.
It had to be total and it had to be honest.
I'm prepared to make a donation to the people of this town.
Since you're their representatives, I can tell you that I'm prepared, right now, to give you a James Madison.
This nice man's taking you to your aunt.
It's a deal.
I'll show you how to make up your eyes and your lips.
Promise me one thing.
Well, Bill, I'm gonna make you my deputy.
We must protect these investments so the area can continue to prosper and grow.
But if it's straight-up one-to-one you want, then I'm your man.
You and me rode into this county together.
I say this as a friend.
There's a lot of us who'd ride with you.
You might be able to find something out there alone.
I felt obliged to come and pay my respects before moving on.
Harley, you and Lee give me a hand with this door.
You just give us the word.
I know old Pete.
McLeod's depending on you, Scorpio.
They'll get her out for you.
That's the first thing Cross taught me.
Only those I trust know that.
They're both Viennese, both good men.
I've known Zharkov for almost 30 years.
I'd like your opinion.
I want you to take care of someone for me.
He'll know what to do.
Then, when you've recovered your strength, we'll discuss the plan.
They won't hurt you.
Don't worry.
Now, you get a good rest and next week you'll begin a new life.
This is where you'll be living.
I've got something to tell you.
Just relax.
However, I'm counting on you to respond appropriately.
I'll be assisting you through the entire process.
Well, thank you for your help.
Och, you don't want to let them worry you.
It'll do that poor sore throat good.
I invited you.
They will not fail.
We have means of controlling it.
We are not so vulnerable.
I will watch over you.
Consuella is right.
When you can see into this crystal, then you will be ready.
They sure have all the right equipment.
It's all taken care of, Papa.
OK, we'll give them a hand.
I'll take care of Miss Swanson.
Once again skill and daring have overcome fear and anxiety.
The front controls seem to be all right.
We'll do all we can to help you.
We're going to have to go down there and calm everybody else.
We have to give them something to hope for.
Do you want me to come with you?
There is a pilot on the radio telling her what to do, telling her exactly how to do it.
Just hold it steady until I tell you.
You take a rest now.
I'll bet he's gonna help us.
We'll have help up to you real soon.
They'll do everything that can be done.
I'm going with you, Al.
But there is nothing to be alarmed about.
I'll take good care of it.
I think he'd be very gentle.
If I could give you a job, I would do it.
Maybe I can help you to get out of it.
Thanks for the warning.
Could you show me where they are?
You don't have to worry.
I just came to escort you home.
Honey, if you change your mind, just let me know.
I was hoping you'd be an example for him.
Honey, it's nice to have somebody take care of you.
Because I want to talk to you, face to face.
If you wouldn't mind giving me a lift.
I've thought this out very carefully and I know what I'm gonna do.
I want to talk to you tonight.
Could you give me the number of the sorority house?
I don't have any secrets.
Let me tell you what I said when she was born.
He doesn't want any trouble with anyone.
I thought we should get acquainted, since we're neighbours.
Let me tell you something about my life.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
Come in out of the rain.
Any favours that I do for you don't need any payment.
God sees everything.
We'll share it.
The committee wishes to emphasise that there is no evidence of any wider conspiracy.
I'd like you to meet somebody.
Hope you know how to take care of yourself.
But we like to be on a first-name basis with potential candidates.
You're invaluable, Richard.
We're not gonna hurt you.
He's been in uniform nine months but he's a good boy.
You want me to check that oil?
I've been trained for it.
It'll make you feel better.
I know you're all right... and a good woman at heart, even though you might have took a wrong turn in life.
You're my wife and I love you... even if we don't get the baby.
I wanna say I appreciate what Capt. Tanner's done on my behalf.
Thank you all for makin' it unanimous.
It was everything I promised.
You need not be afraid.
Come, my child.
We need you to know what work we'll give you.
You will help our medical research and thereby saving thousands of lives.
You are strong.
I need you.
I will satisfy you.
I'll take care of him.
I find your presence comforting somehow.
The choice is yours.
That, my boy, is much more to the point.
I'll show you how simple this can be... when you know what you're doing.
Don't have bad dreams.
That's the way to do it.
Your brother's a master at it.
She's got "champion" written all over her.
On it, you'll find the safest route.
You look like a man of property.
You win this race, and you'll get three years' pay.
You get a bonus and a raise.
You'd best come home with me.
I'll take you home.
I brought you some strawberries.
Gentlemen, the philosophy is pure Zen and the method is pure science.
There's nothing wrong with missing people.
But this child is the world's hope.
You will be cooperative?
We can attend to your needs.
There and then before the gods, you made a pact only death could break.
Fear not.
You're the experts.
Our friend would never leave prints.
I'm sure you want to be getting home.
He seemed nice enough to me.
Yeah, we're working on it.
I'll let you know when I get it straightened out.
You know, he's... he's been so kind to me.
You mustn't be weak.
Maybe you're right.
Listen, I got a favour to ask ya.
They spent their own dough to get here, and they came here to see us.
You taught that guy a lesson last night.
Listen, if things don't work out, you can get in touch with me in Minneapolis.
I'd want to pay you both.
Do you want a beer or something?
Don't worry, kid!
It's me and you.
If you are really brave and lucky, I can make you very, very rich.
Welcome home!
I'm glad you told me about this.
You've got some legitimate complaints.
We'll try to be fair.
You have my word.
By the way, Mr Kovak, I'd like to praise you for bringing this to my attention.
Do we have a deal?
We'll make an honest buck together.
And the only way we got of holding 'em off is by getting together.
I promise you that.
I want the men to be happy.
You guys don't hear nothing, cos if you did we wouldn't be sitting here.
Johnny knows what the men want.
If it's OK with you, I'd just like to hold 'em here in my hand.
I'll talk to him.
You're becoming an important man, John.
You were right about Graham.
You got the proof.
You can count on that.
I'd rather negotiate with you any day.
You'll have your own room with all the conveniences.
As often as I could, I went to see him at his villa near Naples.
It's just fear and priggishness to believe in limits.
I'll bring you your breakfast.
I called you as soon as I heard.
Listen, I've got something for you.
Then you take care of her.
I got something for you now.
Thank you, thank you, thank you...
No sweat.
Dorfman, I've given this a lot of thought.
I'm waiting for reports from some of you.
I think you know everybody here.
Let me take your coat.
I need you so much.
We're just the guys to do it.
You want to know something interesting?
We've solved problems before.
These experiments save a lot of lives.
I'd like you to have this.
I mean, all you have to do is to step aside with immense fortune.
My wife does not exaggerate.
There's no code we can't break.
But you have me.
I'll fly tomorrow to Sardinia and tell you all I know.
I represent your partner.
Your father always called him the house genius.
From now on I want you to report directly to me and only to me.
Miss Roffe, could I have a word with you in private?
Sam was good to me.
I owe him a lot.
I agree with you.
My very best friends.
You know what you ought to do, love?
There'll be someone, don't worry.
You are doing very well.
You can make it, old girl!
That man really does his job.
I think it'll support us.
If I can do anything for you, let me know.
Everybody relax.
But he's the best cameraman I know.
You want to come inside?
He says he doesn't want presents, but you know him.
You must have some idea where he was going.
Everything that could go wrong was considered.
Every part is tested again and again.
I'll follow you.
They cannot be here, so we ask you to consider them in your decision.
Get me someone you trust.
I expect you to take care of them.
He was the sanest man I ever knew.
You have to have faith.
I want to talk to you.
Listen, don't forget my door is always open to artistic people.
We care about you.
I forgive you.
Find and fulfill your destiny.
Besides, whoever marries her will rule the entire kingdom.
Good boy, good boy.
Have courage, princess.
Take me with you!
Hephaestus will do what he can.
Need a little help.
Well, I was wondering if you could hold something for me.
I'll be in my office if you need me.
And I want to thank you for making me join the Army.
I'll take care of you.
That's a good idea.
Hey, captain, could we get a ride with you?
I'll respect you even more.
I'll make you a millionaire in four months.
So I'm just asking you... to be with me.
You and me, we do business.
But Desmond is a very good chancellor.
That's a good thing to know, Frank.
A vocation to love God, help the poor, solace the sick and dying.
I'll give you a ride back to the chancery.
He runs the best parish in the archdiocese, and he's a good man.
Well, I can have a word with you.
Guess my old man's not such a bad guy after all.
Could you do it for me today, please?
I think maybe he'll listen to you.
I hate to ask you this after you've been so helpful but could you do something for me tonight?
The more people who understand our work, the better.
I appreciate your letting me come.
You know the routine.
If you need me, just pull this.
If he called, I'd tell you.
Honey, you comin' to bed?
Here, we'll take care of this.
What are good friends for anyway?
And you are definitely not insane.
Of course you're not crazy.
She is my best friend.
We know that there is nothing wrong with you medically.
I want you to get some sleep tonight.
Did the kids get to eat all right?
Make yourself comfortable.
But if it isn't me, then we have to make a deal, you and I, to accept that fact and find a way to stop it, OK?
Well, it's our way of trying to understand.
You'd still be my Carla.
Just put me in your pocket and take me with you.
Why don't you sit down and have something to eat?
I'll be home in a couple of hours.
I'm gonna go get the kids.
Look, is there someplace that we could go and talk?
We have an idea that might help.
Let me show you to your new house.
I'm afraid we're not able to provide you with all the conveniences, but we hope you'll find it comfortable.
I also understand that I care very much what happens to you.
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's for your own good.
Tell me the whole story from the beginning.
We all make mistakes.
Joe, you got to trust me.
You're my hero.
Want me to help?
These are good workers.
Well, I want to thank you and your wife for all your help.
I brought my man Charlie here to see how you big boys work.
And I know how hard you been working to build somethin' for yourself and Marcy.
Smart man, he's gonna play his cards right tight up against his chest.
Go get my children and you bring them back.
Don't worry, Mama, we'll find them.
Somebody ought to stay with Ma and Pa.
I got something here that belongs to you.
Well, I sure do appreciate you boys busting me out.
If you got a plan, Jack, you better be letting me in on it.
And when the shooting starts... she'll be there to look after the girls.
I recall this belongs to you.
Thank you very much for your attention and your interest
Can I ask you something?
Oh Mr. Neal, everything ok?
Thank you for telling me the truth.
You deserve it.
He might have a job for you.
You're not dumb.
I've got some job possibilities for you.
We haven't left each other's side for the last two weeks.
Just let me take her back with me.
