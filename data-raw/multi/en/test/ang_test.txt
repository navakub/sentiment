Don't kick me, I won't shut up.
I don't like reporters.
Scram the son of a bitch.
Goddamn it, do something.
Damn it, shut up!
No way Uncle Joe is going to talk me into cutting celery again.
I told you never to ask me how I feel.
If that's humor, don't bother.
It's just not that cute anymore.
So the basic problem is that I'm still around?
What do you mean, I'm not the type?
Will you shut up about the Army?
I don't think so and I don't care and I don't have the time.
Don't make me shoot you.
Any of you guys call me Francis, and I'll kill you.
You don't know a damn thing about soldiering.
I ain't talking about that crap!
Look, if you don't want me in your Army, kick me out... but get off my back.
The absence of a plan is ridiculous.
You are in trouble!
What the hell do you think that I do?
I change cars like other guys change their fuckin' shoes!
Why you gotta shout?
If not, get the fuck off my car!
What am I, a fuckin' stranger?
Mind your own business, would you?
Who the hell are you to ask all these questions?
And I don't care whether you go down with him or not.
What's this bullshit?
Just stay out of this.
You're dead, you sons of bitches.
I've called you dozens of times.
Don't raise your voice to me.
I can raise my voice in my own home.
Stop yelling.
I hate this whole thing.
You're not telling me everything.
I'm not hiding from anybody or anything!
Die, you bastard!
I want those two guys banished from her life.
Will you let me sleep?
You stay away from my baby.
And you can't make me.
Shoot him!
All right, Savannah, that's enough.
You get in trouble over there, and I'd have a hell of a time gettin' you out.
I can't afford a fuckin' dream house!
Hey, Beef, if Charlie says the van was empty, the van was empty.
You should have learned by now!
I won't let Jessica live like this.
I'm not coming in there!
If you have something to say, say it and get out.
I hate when you do that.
I'm not going down there to get a tan.
Why must I always be the one who puts the cat out.
There's no bloody exits.
Get the fuck out of this country.
Shut the fucking blinds, will you?
You know I am obliged to report you to the authorities.
Charlie, you had no right to do something like that.
You are so infuriating.
Why don't you leave me alone when I'm sleeping?
I'll get a lock on my door and keep your ass out of here, Mookie.
I hate this frigging place.
Why don't you both shut up?
Turn the fucking water off!
I hate this place. I hate this place.
You really think you know what's best for us, Pino?
I don't care if you fire me this exact fucking moment.
If you're saying what I'm thinking you're saying, you better not say it because I don't wanna hear it.
Get out of here!
Nobody gives a shit, believe me!
I don't owe you jack shit.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
I should have taken the bus.
Shut up and get your ass here!
Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
No, I told you I don't wanna do that anymore.
So this is what it's gonna be, huh?
I'm gonna see it if I have to go blind trying.
I strongly suggest you don't mess with G-Fresh anymore!
You mess with him, we mess with you!
I don't want the money if this is how you have to earn it!
I hate you!
What the fuck?
Goddamn it.
Leave me alone.
What the fuck are you on about?
Get out of the way!
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck?
Son of a bitch!
