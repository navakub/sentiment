Edie, they'll kill you too.
This looks like a mind-fuck to me.
I worry about you, that's all.
School's gonna be a problem for the kids.
It tried to kill my Raymond!
It's a monster!
She had a bit of an accident back there.
You know, Pran is not gonna last five minutes out there.
Please I don't want anyone to be bad to my wife.
I'm trapped, Sydney.
I fear really fear for the future.
You'll land us all in prison.
This means Siberia, for sure.
I'm not ready for this.
To tell you the truth, New York frightens me.
I have to warn the Soviets in the clearest possible terms that they risk taking us to the brink of an armed confrontation with incalculable consequences for all mankind.
These terrorist attacks are aimed at you.
Anyone in your vicinity is in danger.
Isn't that rather exposing the First Lady to some risk?
I am not prepared for wells to run dry!
I think we're being set up.
Beth, you're making me very nervous.
Yeah, then why are you trying to hurt me?
You're scaring me.
Is Mommy going to be all right?
They'd never approve of that being released.
She pulls back on the trigger and at that moment I wake up screaming.
I had the most frightening experience.
I'm in a strange man surrounded by strangers in a strange room!
I can't breathe in here.
Benny, look out for the Red Car!
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.
I think I'm gonna faint.
It's not going to be a problem, is it, Tess?
I don't know what the hell to do.
It's gonna be a massacre.
We've to get out of here and get help!
They really do know where I'm hiding, Geoffrey?
It's a trap.
Right in the middle of our celebration... the firebase got hit by a mortar attack.
I'm trapped.
You know what would happen if Chet found out?
Get out while we're still ahead and alive.
I want you to be on fucking guard, man.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.
So what's gonna happen to me?
Are you trying to get me killed?
Your parents'll kill me.
Are you gonna shoot me?
Somebody help me, please.
I don't want any trouble.
That's dangerous.
Are you following me?
It's a cruel disease.
Go to bed at night happy and then murdered.
What is schizophrenia but a horrifying state where what's in here doesn't match what's out there?
Paul could've been killed by that intruder.
She's going to die if you don't help me.
Guns make me nervous.
But they're all dead.
I need your help.
Watch your head.
Be careful.
Is he dead?
What happened?
Get down!
It was an accident.
Help me!
Something's wrong.
Somebody help me!
