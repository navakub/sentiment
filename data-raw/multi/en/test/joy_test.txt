Really, I've never been happier.
I like it!
Things were going wonderfully well.
You're the prettiest woman in the room, sweetheart.
It was very nice to meet you.
Yeah, he's alive and well and living in Phoenix.
As a matter of fact, you look great.
You're so beautiful.
Well, we've been very happy here.
We've been very happy here.
Wasn't that wonderful?
Adiran, I'm just very happy to be here.
I got a great personality, you ask anybody.
Hey, it's another delightful day here in vacation land.
I know you're crazy about me.
There is nothing like a good cigar.
She's a beautiful tough cookie.
Actually, I'm feeling pretty relaxed now.
You sure are pretty.
I really liked the idea.
This is great!
The town is perfectly all right.
I love this!
It's nice to have company for tea.
They gave me a piece of candy in the store.
You're positively an incredible human being.
And in the enchantment of the moment, we'd let poetry work its magic.
Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods were created, gentlemen.
For the first time in my whole life, I know what I want to do.
The most beautiful poetry can be about simple things like a cat, or a flower, or rain.
I was good.
I was really good.
I'll hit you with nine quarters per package, and that's just cos I'm feeling good.
We got a good thing goin' here.
It's good for the soul.
That's a nice outfit.
I love it.
Isn't technology wonderful?
God, that's beautiful.
It's so nice out there.
Isn't she gorgeous?
My heart is packed so full of love for you.
Now, these legs are very nice.
Excellent!
Very good!
Oh, very nice.
This is good.
You make me very happy.
Is that a fine-lookin' woman or what?
Chad had a great time.
Wally had a great time.
A smokin' good time.
They send you champagne.
How wonderful!
Isn't this the finest time?
I want to get down on my knees and thank God.
I remembered why I loved paintings in the first place, what got me into this.
Although I think it's a very fine Kandinsky.
We came outside giddy and reeling.
That is a beautiful thing.
That night was the happiest night I ever had.
That was the happiest night he ever had.
That was magical, that Salinger stuff.
I only have sex when I'm happy.
This is really fun.
People who truly loved are likely to love again.
Thank Victoria for the nice dinner.
I'm glad you liked it.
I love the smell of commerce in the morning!
Where do you get those wonderful toys?
Seriously, she is a woman who loves our great state.
Look at all the smiling faces.
I'm so glad you've come home safely.
Ever since the first day I laid eyes on you, I knew I had to be yours and yours alone.
Your hair looks nice today.
I think I've finally found a sport I like.
Boy, you sure are a good-looker.
That's why audiences love me.
That sounds swell, Corky.
I think you're cute.
If your mother were alive, she'd be so happy.
Lunch was wonderful.
I got offered a part in a movie.
Oh, you're the best, Joe.
It does feel better to get it out.
Go on, give yourself a treat.
Oh, you make me so hot!
I have an idea!
I love him.
I love it.
What a pleasure.
It's good.
That was fun.
How thoughtful.
Perfect.
Well, that's easy.
Home sweet home.
Great!
That's sweet.
