It'll be broken by dinner.
No, I just thought we could spend the day together.
I get pissed off, my wife gets embarrassed, the kids are confused.
Carol hits the ceiling and throws me out.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, you know...
I'm talking too much.
The Shaffer woman died today.
My father's in the hospital again.
You can at least, for Christ's sake... lie to me.
I don't feel so good.
Maybe he's got the flu or something
We know you're sad, buddy, but you gotta go to school.
I have no idea what to do.
It's too late for that, Victor.
I wish I could have made her understand.
The queue was endless.
I hate my life.
They said I was crazy, so they sent me to a mental hospital.
It's a bit humiliating, always borrowing Anatoly's place.
I think I care too much.
I have worked and struggled to make myself an American.
I didn't mean it that way.
When I think of that kid, I want to cry.
Because it was my misery.
Now you know that the saddest thing in the world is life.
Our lives are woven together in a fabric, but the connections that make society strong also make it vulnerable.
And then three weeks ago I suffered a nervous breakdown.
When we first went there, Ben, he could barely speak.
When Michael died, Erica was only five.
You think you should have done something different but it's not your fault that Erica died.
My father died of a heart attack.
I had no right to put you through all that.
Don't look so depressed.
Teddy never made it.
Little Katie's been so lonely...
I've been stuck here for 20 years.
It isn't like it used to be.
The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy.
And he will be missed.
It's hard being a dope fiend.
Yeah, but he's not gonna take me along any more, is he?
Don't know if I'm ever gonna get my nails done now.
This kid's cryin', man.
I promised your father I'd take care of you.
I just hate to see a good man go to waste.
If Helen found out, it would kill her.
This is a very sad day for me.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I guess this must seem pretty pathetic to a guy like you.
I feel like such a fool.
Well, you know, there wasn't much we could do.
Mom, Casey died.
He got run over by a car.
My grandparents were killed in the war.
Our kids, struggling through their lives.
Everyone sees this thing except me.
As it is, this is not the life I want for our children, for myself and for you.
She just seems, I don't know, lonely.
This is not my day.
I could burn in hell for the lies I told about you.
And what most people don't see... is just how hard it is to do the right thing.
I'd be so happy if that were really true, Evelyn.
I was the world's nicest guy, and they ruined my life for no reason.
Sorry about that.
That's not good.
She's gone.
You're killing me.
I can't do this.
I miss you too.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore.
