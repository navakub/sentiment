So it really is the same old Sparky that we all knew and loved.
Don't you want to go to New York?
I thought they said they was from Rome.
You sound further away than that.
You're happy all the time?
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I sit up and wonder where I am.
You don't like jazz, pal?
How'd they know you were on this train?
I thought they were with Mackenzie.
Fritz, are you leaving the company or something?
Is that what you're worried about?
Oh, God, it even has a barn.
What brings you back so early?
I didn't know you were a music aficionado.
I haven't seen you around their office, though.
Why should today be any different, you know what I mean?
It's funny, she didn't mention a husband.
I can't believe it myself.
Hey, who turned out the lights?
I just saved your life, and you still don't trust me?
You look different.
You walk awful fast for a little thing don't you?
Damn Charley, this is your last wish?
Look at all that underwear.
Why's she making those funny noises?
That's not bad for a blind man.
Isn't this the same desk...?
I don't know what to say.
Where are the females?
I haven't seen you for a week.
I saw it, but I didn't believe it.
You don't believe that stuff, do you?
That's very rare.
I thought politics interested you.
How did you find that out?
Oh, that's what you're working on?
I thought you weren't coming home till tomorrow.
Daddy, you found Suzy!
You sure this is the right address?
Why is there a statue of a husky?
Oh, this is a Kandinsky!
He promised you parts in Cats?
You've been to the top of the Sistine Chapel?
So, I heard you we're going to propose to Brandi Svenning in some theme park.
You have the most unusual name, too.
This is a better game than I thought.
I wondered why I was suddenly being treated with respect.
Look at all these happy families.
My goodness, you have such an attractive little garden here.
I don't think I've seen you before.
Unbelievable.
Oh, my goodness.
Holy shit.
You're kidding, right?
Wow!
Oh, my God.
It's unbelievable.
It's a miracle.
I don't believe it.
Are you serious?
Oh, my God!
Why am I here?
Why are you here?
Holy shit.
Are you kidding?
How do you know?
