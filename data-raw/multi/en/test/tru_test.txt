I've done what I can for you.
I'd really like to help you.
Tell me the truth.
It's OK, I was thinking the same thing.
Well, we'll figure something out.
I'm sure there is a very logical explanation for all this.
I won't leave you.
I'd prefer it if it was you.
That's what friends are for.
Are you feeling well, Anatoly?
I think it's safe.
Thank you for protection.
I respect your new life.
You've been greatest friend to me.
My mother and dad'll help us, I'm sure they will.
If central government should ever fail, power can be transferred instead to a system of local officials dispersed across the country.
We thought you'd be safer on the ground.
I've always had faith in him.
I learned it from you, Fritz.
Phil Nozaki was a good cop.
Yes, I was responsible.
You don't have to thank me.
I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there.
And we learned a lot from you.
Jack, since you're not going on the cruise, I could use you at the store on Monday.
I need a lift home.
No, honey the drink's on me.
It almost feels like you're one of us now.
And it's like she wants to be my mentor, which is exactly what I needed.
You're in no particular danger, I think.
I'll need help bathing and changing.
I heard you're having some trouble finding help.
Thank you for keeping us alive.
We're your family now, Chavez.
You are my only hope.
I supply arms and equipment to anyone who will pay the price.
They are perfectly safe.
Hold my hand, please?
I think you might be my best brother, too.
You got to learn how to forgive.
I know I can always count on you.
Even though it may seem silly or wrong, you must try.
You see, Pino, this is a respectable business and there's nothing wrong with that.
We want to thank you all for making our lives just a little brighter, here on We Love Radio.
I may smack you around every once in a while, but I'm still your brother.
Sal, I gotta go see my son, if it's all right with you.
Tom knew his way around the old neighbourhoods.
I'd known Tom since I was an altar boy.
I know the feeling.
He's really been like a father to me.
I need you to give me some money.
He's a real pro.
Helen and I really did care about you.
But our kid will have a loving mother and father, and all the advantages that I can give him.
I could sure use your help.
Yeah, let's talk business, my friend
We're together on that, aren't we?
You need a hand with those?
You can depend on me for an additional overcall of 250.
He was very understanding.
Well, I'm going to trust you.
You deserve a nice, clean place.
I got faith in you.
This is the right path for you.
How can we ever repay you?
Can you share with me?
I understand.
Close your eyes.
I've got a surprise for you.
Follow me.
No more tears.
Don't worry.
Maybe you're right.
Let me explain something to you.
Promise me.
I really appreciate that.
I have something for you.
Can you explain that to me?
Let's be honest.
Good boy.
Don't worry.
I know he was your friend.
I promise.
