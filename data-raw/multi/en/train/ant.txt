He's waiting for you.
How about two foursomes of golf, huh?
You could make a handsome profit on your stock.
Well, we want our dough.
When he comes out, tell him I'll be back.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
And after dinner we could go...
Mr Dickson wants to see you right away.
And you and I are going out together.
I'll step you around this town like you've never been stepped before.
We'll have dinner at the St Regis, go to a nice snappy show, then to a nightclub, sit and listen to the soft music, and who knows?
I might break down and dance with you.
I'll wait for you upstairs.
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Come on up for just a few minutes.
We'll have just one drink and then we'll go.
I'm going to call up Lou now.
Don't lose a moment.
I'm going right down.
We want it now.
How much longer is this Dickson going to hold out?
All we want to do is talk to you.
I want to ask you something.
Dickson, I'd like to talk with you about the bank.
I've got to get in there.
You've got to come out.
I'm going to put a lot of money in here.
We've been waiting...
Mrs Dickson and I are going on the honeymoon.
I'm going to tell him someday just exactly what I think of him.
What news have you from the factory, dear?
I can't wait.
I want a room, a big room.
I want to speak...
See you later.
But there's tomorrow.
I wonder if I could remind the Baron of his promise... that I might speak to him at any time?
I wonder if the Baron would take the trouble to come to my beautiful room?
I wonder if you'd like to see my bathroom?
Be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam.
Our train leaves early tomorrow morning.
But I'll speak with you later.
We're going home.
We were just going to dance.
You wanted to see me?
I'll see you later.
Are you coming to the theater?
Come and fetch me, ch√©ri...
I've always wanted to go to Paris.
Will you be back for breakfast?
There's something I'd like to ask you.
We'll have a crew yet!
His Excellency's waiting for you!
And I'm willing to pay for what I want.
He'll come here first.
This will be our child.
Yes, I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!
Susan, I hope this time you've come to stay.
Ned will tell you exactly when to put in an appearance.
Is there anything else you'd like to know about me?
Better make it tomorrow.
Darling, tell me, when are you to announce the exciting news about Julia?
Shortly after midnight as a surprise.
You'll have a lot more fun with Julia.
Let's go downstairs and celebrate.
Linda, now you must get married.
I'll do everything I can to make a success of it.
We'll keep her here, won't we?
I hope to see more of you, when you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.
The war will be over in a few weeks, and I'll be coming back to you.
When the war's over, Ashley.
I'm going to join up with our brave lads in gray.
Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable, and I'd like a long visit.
You come in and sit a minute with me.
But I will come back.
Oh, Rhett, can I have a chocolate one stuffed with meringue?
Then I'll take her a petticoat.
Will you take me away from here?
We'll go tomorrow.
And when it comes time for her to marry... well, she'll be a little princess.
I expect the angels fights on your side, Miss Melly.
All you need now is a divorce, and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
I'm going to Charleston, back where I belong.
I want the Governor's residence, Jackson City.
Tell Jim Taylor I'm coming home.
If you and Joe'll gab on about this appointment, I'll see the committees.
We'll hurry.
He'll show up.
Boy, that'll be something.
You know what I'll do in the morning?
It will be a fine thing to do.
It'll put you right in the mood.
If we could get the poor kids off the streets for a few months every summer and let them learn something about nature and American ideals.
This is the calendar for the day.
See you in the White House, Joe.
When the Vice-president calls you, I'll meet you in the centre aisle.
You can talk all you want to now.
He'll be a good friend.
It'll be great experience for you.
I've been aching to mention it to you.
I'm anxious to get back to the office.
It's simple and I'm helping, so we knock it off in three or four days.
Couldn't we have something brought in on trays like big executives?
I said, shall we start...
Go right ahead.
Let's get down to particulars.
Let's get on with this.
Are you ready?
The show is about to commence.
I'm taking him out to see monuments.
I would like to come to your camp.
She may be the next first lady.
If you're going to wonder, let's go and do it over a steak.
Let's get married.
Okay, then let's get going.
Meet the man I'm going to marry.
We're gonna get married.
I'm taking the next plane home.
I'll call when I'm through with Smith.
Come on over to my place.
Let's go in.
We could be rich, if you say the word.
We won't have to worry about our future if you're willing to raffle off your past.
The Count says if it could be as soon as possible.
All right, I'll see him right away.
Yes, all right, I will call you later.
Gentlemen, how about a little lunch?
I just said, let's have some lunch.
Listen, a special envoy is coming from Moscow today.
Let's not waste any time.
It won't be long now, comrades.
How long must we wait here?
The elevator will get you up in three minutes.
And now, I'll show you the greatest attraction of all.
You might be an interesting subject of study.
No, but the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Where shall we begin?
I will start with you.
Yes, I'd like to say it 1,000 times.
While you are studying it, I will eat.
Not until I've made you laugh at least once.
I'm going to tell you a funny story.
First, I would like to take off my hat.
Let's go to some other place.
It'll all be over by Thursday.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
I want to talk to my brothers.
I want to overthrow the Grand Duchess.
Now, let's have some music.
I have lots of things to attend to today, Leon.
Darling, your present just arrived.
I want to see a friend of mine, a very dear friend.
The opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
I'll tell you later.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married... when he comes back from the maneuvers.
I'll travel wherever there are Russian commissions.
Come live with me And be my love
Let me finish, sweet.
Your blood will be on fire to lead some new command, some far adventure.
We march tonight.
I'll speak with you first.
When he gets off the train, he'll pick up some gold and send it to me.
A dollar's a dollar, and every dollar is taking me further West.
I'll get a job until I get a grubstake, and then I'll try again somewhere.
And tell her her old granddad will be back soon.
We're gonna be rich!
I've got to get a contract signed.
I'm expecting a baby.
Now he'll be able to have everything he's always wanted and couldn't afford.
Another miracle will happen.
Gentlemen, how would you all like a mint julep?
If you insist, I'll have eight more.
Come on, let's sing.
Let's sing!
I feel another song coming on.
How about some more mint juice?
In a week, I can sell them anything.
We must be coming to the station.
We'll be out of this tunnel in a minute.
Here they come!
But do sit down and have some coffee.
Now that we've found each other again, I hope I shall see something of you.
I'll drive you somewhere in the car.
Let's go home.
You would like to see them, wouldn't you?
I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life.
All we want you to do is tell us what you saw.
With England conquered, nothing can stand in our way.
Northern Africa, Europe as far east as the Urals... then the New World, to the north, to the south... west to the Pacific, over the Pacific to China and the Indies... will our empire spread.
You'll soon be in England now.
Now to business.
We'll find out someday.
Now, we better start all over.
I mean, I want to be something besides just a plain fighter... even though Murdock is a champ and a swell guy.
I'd love to go with you, Mr. Murdock.
Brother Jeeter, will you join me in a song?
Let me taste it.
Come sit down here beside me, and I'll give you a horn of your own.
Come, let's go get that automobile.
One of these days, I'm gonna spend me the rest of my life in one of these hot...
Well, maybe things will be better over there.
Well, I hope you've managed to get the money, Mr. Lester.
Yeah, I can just tell the way it smells that this is gonna be a great year for cotton, yeah.
Got a chance of a job there?
We're trying to get to a place called Soda City, a couple of hundred miles north, I think.
You know, I think I'll go back East and work for a while.
Havana will be very gay this season.
I got to catch that boat.
I'm gettin' me a gun, some liquor and a gold commissioner.
Waiting for an answer.
Oh, it will be a beautiful attack.
I'm going for wine.
Then I'm going to write him a letter right now and cheer him up.
There'll be other dinners, Phil.
Have a cigar, Kirby, and I'll join you.
Why don't you go play the piano?
How I'd love to hit the jackpot.
I'll be back.
This job isn't going to be like any of the others, Hank.
We'll get a new one.
Tonight, I hand in my resignation.
I'll talk to you later.
Why don't you have another one?
We're going to celebrate.
I want some more beer.
Someone will pass by soon.
Maybe they can take us.
Tonight we'll meet our contacts.
I'll have a ginger ale with a twist of lemon.
But I won't know till tomorrow, along about noon.
Can we have coffee?
I'll go back to Chicago and be a Fuller Brush girl.
Are you going to be married?
I want some orange juice, eggs, bacon, toasted muffin and lots of coffee.
This is what I'd like to have someday.
Let me see the jewel.
Prepare to dismount!
But in no time at all, you'll be soldiers.
Once again, and faster.
You think you'd like to try that before you eat?
In six months, we'll have the finest drill team in the world.
You will dine with me?
How about a cup of coffee?
Soon as we get to Riker's, we'll sleep then.
You see, this'll be my very first own home.
And how about some pepper and salt and vinegar, eh?
You can be famous.
No, let's sing about us.
Would you like a little more tea?
Won't you tell us all about it?
When I get home, I shall write a book about this place.
If I hurry, perhaps I might even be home in time for tea.
Then when I'm good and ready, we come out with a big extra.
Let me have those things.
And wait till you see the pictures.
Wanna hear what I wrote about you?
We all wanna get out, and we're going to.
By Tuesday, everyone in the state will know you.
What's the latest?
We're really gonna have a great time.
One of these days, I'll get the facts and print them.
Maybe I'll run into you.
Maybe you'll buy me a couple of drinks.
Then I wanna make a speech from the top of the hill.
She'll look like a million.
I'm ready.
If we take them out now, they can fight again tomorrow.
Let's have coffee together.
We'll discuss it later, whenever you're ready.
We're due back in Berlin as early this evening as we can make it.
What about a little music?
You better have something for me.
Bruce is coming tomorrow night.
Company's coming.
No, but you know that bottle of whisky we had in the kitchen all this time?
Tomorrow, you'll be looking for a new cobbler or a new teacher.
Don't you want to hear the rest of it?
No, some day I'm really going to Copenhagen.
Imagine, Hans, you'll be the first.
I've decided to go to Copenhagen, just like I made it up in a story.
Well, what are we waiting for?
I will behave beautifully this afternoon, you will see.
Shall I tell you the rest of the story?
Although I'm a duckling today, tomorrow I'm a swan
I couldn't possibly sit still.
You and me getting ready to go to the opera house in Copenhagen.
Tell us about the king!
Oh, I wanted you to see this advertising layout.
That's one of the things I hope the formula will alleviate.
What might be the first reaction?
Oh, we can do lots of things by then.
Oh, I'll get the hang of it soon.
I'm gonna be good, you wait.
Listen to this.
Undoubtedly we can expect something soon.
We're standing on the brink of a new world, and...
I could do with a lot of that.
We'll have Tobruk in a few days.
Now, listen, stow the chatter, mate, and get on that banjo.
You reckon this'll make the colonel happy?
I'll see you tomorrow.

You know, we still got to decorate.
This would make a terrific playroom.
Let me just look at you.
Actually, we wanted to do some remodeling first.
I guess you're looking for a place right away, aren't you?
I've got Scotch, I've got vodka, there's a nice Chablis...
We got a new man coming in.
How am I gonna get to first base with this girl?
God, I've gotta be with her, at least till she learns my name.
And I'd like to get to know all of you by having you write down your name, address, your home and work phone on paper, and passing it forward.
Hey, what kind of news are you leaving me there?
You want to see a movie or something?
They're waiting for enlightenment.
We'd like to welcome you to Vietnam, the country that is more stimulating than a strong cup of cappuccino or an espresso enema.
You skin will look and feel a whole lot better.
I wonder what's on the television?
It doesn't matter how long it takes, we'll be back in business.
I need a drink.
Miss, has the Cowboy ever told you of his incredible tolerance for pain?
Can I have a bite?
There's somethin' I want to show you.
Oh, you're gonna like this one.
Now, you mind if I dance with your wife?
Let's belly up to the bar and get us some refreshment.
I'd like to introduce you to...
They'll be here tomorrow, honey.
Can he stay here for a couple of days?
Dolores, a bourbon, and make it a double.
I think you want a drink.
I want to see it now!
I think your lab boys will find that paint's a perfect match.
Bob's looking for a new assistant and wants to meet you for a drink.
Let's give her a shout, shall we?
Well, I'll fly down to Memphis in the morning and feel them out.
You sure she's gonna show?
How hard would it be to crash a wedding?
Can you get me in to see the Governor?
Charley, you'll come with me?
Gonna be held as sheriff, if they elect me.
We are presenting a performance.
I will wait for you!
I'm going with you.
I always feel rejuvenated by a touch of adventure.
This is a good omen, what?
Mom would love that.
Come on, one more time and you win the grand prize.
Come on, we don't wanna miss our bus.
We should get one of those, honey.
Why don't you come in and join...
Have them send me up some roast chicken and chocolate pudding.
Mr Parker, there's someone I'd like you to meet.
Nice guy, I hope.
They believe they're destined for great things, just like many of you.
Let's go, gentlemen.
Now, who's next?
Yeah, I might be going to Yale.
Then you have to talk to him before tomorrow night.
I brought you these and a poem I wrote for you.
Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?
We'll sit in the back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
You're going to Harvard and you're gonna be a doctor.
Peoples, my stomach's been grumbling, but help has arrived.
I want you to get me a quart of beer, Miller High Life.
I'm about to go get a slice right now.
I want some flowers.
If you don't mind, I'm gonna sit right here, catch myself a breeze or two, and then I'll be on my way.
I want coconut.
Maybe I ought to be a hero more often, huh?
I'll be back tonight.
Sal, start counting my money tonight 'cause I gots to get paid.
So, did you watch I Spy last night?
So, do you think you could get me a TV?
Hey, babe, you playin' cards?
Dianne, why don't you take your coat off and stay awhile?
Let's just see what's in there.
Yeah, I'd love a cold beer.
You like the color, Anna?
I have something I'd like to show you.
I was thinking of picking up a pizza and going home.
You're welcome to join me.
Well, some other time, then?
Call me as soon as you find it out.
Miss Beckett, I've been looking for you.
This afternoon I want you to fly to Miami and see the distributors.
Do you believe that the army will have more success?
Well, let them see me.
Hurry up.
We're ready and waiting.
Because you know I'm gonna walk out of that court, just like I did before.
